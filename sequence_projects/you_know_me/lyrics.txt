you know me
anytime you hit me it's just not a good time
guess there's always something, they say that's a good sign
maybe good times don't come like they used to
never satisfied, you would think it's by design
no matter what I'm doin it's just not enough
the way it hurts inside it's just like when you fall in love
it's not enough to have it all, I want it all at once
oh that's all it was
you know me
I'm just getting started baby this is just a test run
I will take a fucking minute if I get one
wouldn't know what to do with it if I did
and if I did
you know me
I'm still just as petty as the old me
still remember everything they told me
so tell these motherfuckers they can blow me
slowly
you know me
you know me
you know me
you know me
you know me
I'm still pulling rabbits out of hats
you know I had to buff up all the stats
for charlotte goin plat' I got a plaque
left it in the box I don't know what to do with that
love is love but I could never settle for the background
took some time to figure out the vision but I'm back now
me and J just plotted out the summer, got it mapped out
locked in, strapped down
you know me
I'm not where I wanna be but it's a good start
maybe when we look back this'll be the good part
this might be the part where we knew but we didn't know
and I'll pretend like that's how it was meant to go
but you know me
I just never learned how to let it go
even after everybody's headed home, headed home
you know me
you know me
you know me
you know me
