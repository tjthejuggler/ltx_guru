# LTX Juggling Ball Protocol - Progress Summary

## Our Journey So Far

1. **Initial Attempts (Batch 001)**
   - Created simplified JSON-based sequence files
   - Generated .prg files with basic structure
   - Result: Files caused rapid flashing between white and various colors

2. **Accurate Binary Structure (Batch 002)**
   - Analyzed working examples to match binary structure exactly
   - Created generator that precisely replicated file format
   - Result: Still experienced rapid flashing, but with correct base colors

3. **Long Duration Testing (Batch 003)**
   - Increased durations from 10 seconds to 100-500 seconds
   - Modified all duration-related bytes in the file format
   - Result: White with quick flashes to intended colors once per second

4. **Direct Copy Approach (Batch 004)**
   - Directly copied binary structure of known working examples
   - Only changed RGB color values, preserved all other bytes
   - Result: **SUCCESS!** Solid colors and correct transitions with proper timing

5. **Multi-Color Sequences (Batch 005)**
   - Extended the successful direct copy approach to support multiple colors
   - Created RGB cycle, rainbow, and custom sequence tests
   - Result: Pending testing

## Key Discoveries

1. **Direct Copy Works**: The most reliable approach is to directly copy the binary structure of known working examples and only change the RGB color values.

2. **Duration Modification Fails**: Attempting to modify duration values in the file format results in unexpected behavior (white with quick flashes).

3. **Binary Structure Critical**: The exact binary structure of the file is crucial for proper operation. Even small deviations can cause unexpected behavior.

4. **Working Examples**:
   - Single color files work correctly with the direct copy approach
   - Two-color transition files work correctly with the direct copy approach
   - Multi-color sequences are being tested

## Current Understanding

The LTX juggling ball protocol appears to be very sensitive to the exact binary structure of the .prg files. Our attempts to interpret and modify the file format (especially duration values) resulted in unexpected behavior, but directly copying known working examples with only color changes works perfectly.

This suggests that there may be checksums, magic values, or other non-obvious elements in the file format that we haven't fully understood yet. However, by using the direct copy approach, we can create functional sequences without needing to fully understand every byte in the format.

## Next Steps

1. Test multi-color sequences to see if our extension of the direct copy approach works for more complex patterns
2. Document the exact binary structure of working files for future reference
3. Create a library of reusable sequence patterns based on the direct copy approach
4. Develop a user-friendly tool for creating custom sequences
