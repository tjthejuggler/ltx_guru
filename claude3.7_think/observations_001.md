# Observations from First Test Batch

The first batch of test files did not perform as intended. Instead of displaying the expected solid colors or patterns, they exhibited rapid flashing behavior:

- `test_solid_blue.prg`: Flashed rapidly between white and green (expected solid blue)
- `test_solid_green.prg`: Flashed rapidly between white and red (expected solid green)
- `test_solid_red.prg`: Flashed rapidly between white and blue (expected solid red)
- `test_simple_alternating.prg` and `test_rgb_slow.prg`: Behaved like test_solid_red.prg, flashing between white and blue
- `test_longer_duration.prg` and `test_blink_red.prg`: Rapidly blinking white (possibly with a little blue)

## Analysis of Working Examples

The user provided hex dumps of working .prg files, which reveal important differences from our generated files:

### Key Observations:

1. **File Structure**: Working files follow a specific binary structure with distinct sections
2. **Header Format**: The fixed header (first 16 bytes) is identical across working examples: `50 52 03 49 4e 05 00 00 00 04 00 08 01 00 50 49`
3. **Variable Header**: Different for single-color vs. multi-color sequences, with proper segment count
4. **Color Representation**: Colors are stored as repeated RGB triplets (e.g., `ff 00 00` for red)
5. **File Size**: Single-color files are 357 bytes (0x165), two-color files are 676 bytes (0x2A4)

### Important Format Details:

- Single color files use segment count = 1 (byte offset 0x14)
- Two color files use segment count = 2 (byte offset 0x14)
- Duration appears to be set at byte offset 0x18-0x19 as value `64 00` (100 in little-endian, representing 10 seconds)
- The segment structure differs significantly from our simplified version

## Conclusions & Next Steps:

1. Our simplified generator creates invalid .prg files that the balls cannot interpret correctly
2. We need to create a generator that exactly matches the format found in the working examples
3. We will create new test files based on the exact byte structure of the working examples
4. Initial tests will focus on single-color files to establish a baseline
