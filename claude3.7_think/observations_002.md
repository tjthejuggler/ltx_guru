# Observations from Second Test Batch

The second batch of test files (using accurate_generator.py) still exhibited rapid flashing behavior:

- `accurate_blue.prg`: Super rapid flashing blue (expected solid blue)
- `accurate_green.prg`: Super rapidly flashing green (expected solid green)
- `accurate_red.prg`: Super rapid flashing red (expected solid red)
- `accurate_blue_to_red.prg`: Super rapid flashing red (expected blue→red transition)
- `accurate_green_to_blue.prg`: Mostly solid blue with possible rapid flashing to red (expected green→blue transition)
- `accurate_red_blink.prg`: Rapid flashing green with possible flashing to red (expected red→black blinking)

## Analysis

1. **Duration Issues**: The user hypothesized that the rapid flashing might be due to very short time periods for each color, causing the program to loop rapidly.

2. **Color Interpretation**: There appears to be some color swapping or misinterpretation. For example:
   - Files intended to show red are flashing red
   - Files intended to show green are flashing green
   - Files intended to show blue are flashing blue
   - But the two-color transitions show unexpected color combinations

3. **Partial Success**: The fact that we're seeing the intended base colors (even if flashing) suggests we're getting closer to the correct format.

## Hypotheses

1. **Duration Encoding**: We may not be encoding the duration correctly in the file format. The balls might be interpreting our 10-second durations (0x64 in hex) as much shorter intervals.

2. **Loop Behavior**: The program might be looping more rapidly than expected, causing the flashing effect.

3. **Color Data Format**: There might be subtleties in how the color data is formatted or interpreted that we're missing.

4. **Segment Structure**: The segment descriptors might need further refinement to match exactly what the balls expect.

## Next Steps

1. Create test files with much longer durations (100 seconds instead of 10 seconds)
2. Examine working examples more closely, particularly focusing on:
   - Exact byte values in the duration fields
   - Segment descriptor structure
   - Color data formatting
3. Create simpler test files with minimal changes from known working examples
4. Document all findings in detail for future reference
