# Observations on Multi-Color Sequence Issues

## Problem Analysis

After examining the examples_fixed files and comparing them with working examples, I've identified the following issues:

1. **Limited Color Transitions**: 
   - The rainbow.prg and custom_sequence.prg files only show the first two colors (red and orange/yellow for rainbow, red and green for custom_sequence)
   - Each color displays for 10 seconds, but no further colors appear

2. **Header Structure Issues**:
   - The problematic files only define two segments in the header (at offset 0x12: `02 00`)
   - All timing values are set to 10 seconds (`0a 00`)

3. **Working Example Analysis**:
   - The working example (2px_red_5_green_10_blue_15.prg) correctly defines:
     - Three segments (at offset 0x12: `03 00`)
     - Different timing values for each color: 5s for red, 10s for green, 15s for blue

4. **Generator Code Issues**:
   - The multi_color_generator.py has several problems:
     - It only creates segment descriptors for the first and last colors
     - It doesn't properly handle the middle segments
     - It doesn't correctly set different durations for each segment
     - The segment structure doesn't match the working examples

```

## Key Differences

1. **Segment Count**: 
   - Working example: `03 00` (3 segments)
   - Problematic files: `02 00` (2 segments)

2. **Timing Values**:
   - Working example: `05 00`, `0a 00`, `0f 00` (5s, 10s, 15s)
   - Problematic files: All `0a 00` (10s)

3. **Segment Descriptors**:
   - Working example: Has proper descriptors for all three segments
   - Problematic files: Only have descriptors for two segments

## Solution Approach

To fix these issues, I need to:

1. Correctly define the number of segments in the header
2. Create proper segment descriptors for all colors in the sequence
3. Set the correct duration for each segment
4. Ensure the segment structure matches the working examples

I'll create an improved generator that correctly handles multiple colors with different durations.
