# New Observations on Improved Sequences

## Unexpected Behaviors

Based on testing the improved sequences, the following unexpected behaviors were observed:

### rgb_cycle.prg:
- Nothing (no light) for 40 seconds
- White for 40 seconds
- Dull green after another 40 seconds
- No light for 40 seconds
- Blue for 2 minutes or longer

### rainbow.prg:
- Cycling through colors very fast
- Only showing green, blue, and cyan (not the full rainbow)

### custom_sequence.prg:
- Super rapid flashing between red and green

## Analysis of Potential Issues

These behaviors are very different from what we expected. Here are some potential issues:

1. **Timing Interpretation**: 
   - The ball might be interpreting our timing values differently than expected
   - The decisecond values might be interpreted as different time units

2. **Segment Structure**:
   - The segment descriptors might not be correctly structured
   - The offsets to color data blocks might be incorrect

3. **Color Data Format**:
   - The color data might not be formatted correctly
   - The RGB values might be interpreted differently by the ball

4. **Header Structure**:
   - The header might have incorrect values for segment count or total duration
   - The offsets in the header might be pointing to wrong locations

5. **Segment Transitions**:
   - The transitions between segments might not be working correctly
   - The ball might be getting stuck in certain segments

## Next Steps for Investigation

To better understand these issues, we should:

1. **Re-examine Working Examples**:
   - Look more closely at the working examples in sequences/works_correctly
   - Pay special attention to the timing values and segment structures

2. **Test with Simpler Sequences**:
   - Create simpler sequences with fewer colors and longer durations
   - Test each component of the generator separately

3. **Modify Timing Values**:
   - Try different timing values to see how they affect the behavior
   - Experiment with much longer durations to see if timing is scaled differently

4. **Check Color Data Format**:
   - Verify that the color data is formatted correctly
   - Ensure that the RGB values are in the correct order and format

5. **Review Segment Descriptors**:
   - Double-check the structure of segment descriptors
   - Ensure that all fields have the correct values

This unexpected behavior suggests that our understanding of the file format is still incomplete, particularly regarding how timing values are interpreted and how segment transitions work.
