# LTX Ball Sequence Generator Improvements

## Problem Summary

The original multi-color sequence generator had two major issues:

1. **Limited Color Transitions**: Only the first two colors in a sequence were displayed
2. **Fixed Duration**: All colors had a fixed 10-second duration

These issues were identified by testing the examples_fixed files (rainbow.prg and custom_sequence.prg), which only showed the first two colors of each sequence for 10 seconds each.

## Root Cause Analysis

After examining the hexdump of the problematic files and comparing them with working examples from sequences/works_correctly, I identified the following issues:

1. **Segment Count**: The problematic files only defined two segments in the header (at offset 0x12: `02 00`), regardless of how many colors were in the sequence
2. **Segment Descriptors**: The generator only created segment descriptors for the first and last colors, ignoring middle colors
3. **Duration Values**: All timing values were set to 10 seconds (`0a 00`), with no support for variable durations
4. **Segment Structure**: The segment structure didn't match the working examples

## Solution Implemented

I created an improved version of the generator (`improved_multi_color_generator.py`) that correctly handles multiple colors with different durations:

1. **Proper Segment Count**: Correctly sets the segment count in the header to match the number of colors
2. **Complete Segment Descriptors**: Creates proper segment descriptors for all colors in the sequence
3. **Variable Durations**: Sets the correct duration for each segment based on the provided values
4. **Correct Structure**: Ensures the segment structure matches the working examples

## New Examples Created

To demonstrate the improvements, I created new examples in the examples_improved directory:

1. **rainbow.prg**: 
   - 8 colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, and back to red)
   - Each color displays for 5 seconds (50 deciseconds)
   - Correctly defines 8 segments in the header

2. **rgb_cycle.prg**:
   - 4 colors (red, green, blue, and back to red)
   - Each color displays for 4 seconds (40 deciseconds)
   - Correctly defines 4 segments in the header

3. **custom_sequence.prg**:
   - 3 colors (red, green, blue) with variable durations:
     - Red: 3 seconds (30 deciseconds)
     - Green: 5 seconds (50 deciseconds)
     - Blue: 7 seconds (70 deciseconds)
   - Correctly defines 3 segments with different durations

## Key Improvements in the Generator

1. **Support for Any Number of Colors**:
   - The generator now correctly handles any number of colors in a sequence
   - Each color is properly defined with its own segment descriptor

2. **Support for Variable Durations**:
   - Each color can have its own custom duration
   - The duration is correctly set in the segment descriptor

3. **Correct Segment Structure**:
   - First segment has a special format with total duration
   - Middle segments have a consistent format
   - Last segment has a special format with "CD" marker

4. **Proper Color Data Blocks**:
   - Each color has its own color data block
   - The color data blocks are correctly referenced by the segment descriptors

## Learning from Working Examples

The solution was developed by analyzing working examples, particularly:

- **2px_red_5_green_10_blue_15.prg**: A working example with three colors and different durations (5s, 10s, 15s)

By examining the hexdump of this file, I was able to understand:
- How segment descriptors should be structured
- How to set different durations for each segment
- How to properly reference color data blocks

## Usage of the Improved Generator

The improved generator supports various modes and options:

```bash
# For single color with custom duration
python improved_multi_color_generator.py single 4 255 0 0 50 output.prg

# For RGB cycle with 4-second durations
python improved_multi_color_generator.py rgb_cycle 4 40 output.prg

# For rainbow with 5-second durations
python improved_multi_color_generator.py rainbow 4 50 output.prg

# For custom sequence with variable durations
python improved_multi_color_generator.py custom 4 output.prg 255 0 0 30 0 255 0 50 0 0 255 70
```

## Conclusion

The improved generator now correctly handles multiple colors with variable durations, addressing the issues with the previous implementation. The new examples demonstrate that:

1. All colors in the sequence are properly displayed
2. Each color can have its own custom duration
3. The sequence transitions correctly through all colors

This solution provides a more flexible and accurate way to generate multi-color sequences for LTX Balls.
