# Observations from Test Batches 003 and 004

## Results Summary

### Long Duration Files (Batch 003)
- `long_red.prg`: White with quick flashes to red exactly once per second
- `long_green.prg`: White with quick flashes to green exactly once per second
- `long_blue.prg`: White with quick flashes to blue exactly once per second
- `long_red_blink.prg`: White with quick flashes to green once per second
- `long_red_to_green.prg`: White with quick flashes alternating between green and blue once per second

### Direct Copy Files (Batch 004)
- `direct_red.prg`: **SOLID RED** without flashing - WORKS CORRECTLY
- `direct_green.prg`: **SOLID GREEN** without flashing - WORKS CORRECTLY
- `direct_blue.prg`: **SOLID BLUE** without flashing - WORKS CORRECTLY
- `direct_red_blink.prg`: **RED for 10 seconds, then OFF for 10 seconds**, repeating - WORKS CORRECTLY
- `direct_red_to_green.prg`: **RED for 10 seconds, then GREEN for 10 seconds**, repeating - WORKS CORRECTLY

## Key Findings

1. **Direct Copy Approach Works Perfectly**: 
   - Files created by directly copying the binary structure of known working examples work exactly as intended
   - Both solid colors and transitions function correctly with proper timing

2. **Duration Modification Doesn't Work**:
   - Attempting to modify the duration values in the file format results in incorrect behavior
   - The balls interpret modified duration values in unexpected ways, resulting in 1-second flashing patterns

3. **Color Data Format**:
   - The color data format in the direct copy approach is correct
   - Simply replacing the RGB values in the color data section while keeping all other bytes identical works

4. **File Structure Is Critical**:
   - The exact binary structure of the file is crucial for proper operation
   - Even small deviations from the working format can cause unexpected behavior

5. **Timing Behavior**:
   - The balls correctly interpret the 10-second timing in the direct copy files
   - This suggests that the timing values are encoded correctly in the original working examples

## Conclusions

1. The direct copy approach is the correct way to generate working .prg files
2. Our previous attempts to interpret and modify the file format were introducing subtle errors
3. For future file generation, we should extend the direct copy approach rather than trying to modify timing values
4. We now have a reliable method to create both solid color and two-color transition sequences

## Next Steps

1. Create more complex sequences by extending the direct copy approach
2. Test sequences with more than two colors
3. Experiment with different transition patterns
4. Document the exact binary structure of working files for future reference
