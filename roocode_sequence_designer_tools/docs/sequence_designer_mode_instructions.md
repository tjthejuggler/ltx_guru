# Sequence Designer Mode Instructions

## File Organization and Types

Always organize project files in the sequence_projects directory using the following structure and file extensions:

```
sequence_projects/
└── song_name/                # Create a subdirectory for each song
    ├── artist_song_name.mp3  # Original audio file
    ├── lyrics.txt            # Raw lyrics text file
    ├── lyrics.json           # Timestamped lyrics
    ├── song_name.ball.json   # Ball sequence file
    ├── song_name.seqdesign.json # Sequence design file
    └── song_name.prg.json    # Compiled program file
```

### File Types and Extensions

| File Type | Extension | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Sequence Design Files | `.seqdesign.json` | High-level sequence design files |
| PRG JSON Files | `.prg.json` | Compiled program files for LTX balls |
| Ball Sequence Files | `.ball.json` | Single ball color sequences |
| Lyrics Timestamps | `.lyrics.json` | Timestamped/aligned lyrics |
| Audio Analysis Reports | `.analysis.json` | Audio analysis data |

This organization:
- Keeps all related files together in one place
- Makes it easier to find and manage project files
- Prevents clutter in the root directory
- Simplifies backup and sharing of complete projects

## Lyrics Processing Workflow

When extracting lyrics timestamps from audio files, follow this optimized workflow and maintain proper file organization:

### RECOMMENDED APPROACH: Using align_lyrics.py (Most Efficient)

The most efficient approach is to use the direct align_lyrics.py tool:

1. **Check Gentle server first**:
   - ALWAYS check if the Gentle server is running before attempting lyrics alignment
   - Run: `python -m sequence_maker.scripts.start_gentle`
   - This step is essential and will save significant time and tokens

2. **Ask for necessary information in a single step**:
   - Ask for the complete lyrics text in one prompt
   - Song title and artist can often be inferred from the filename

3. **Use the align_lyrics.py tool directly**:
   - Save user-provided lyrics to a text file in the same directory as the MP3 file
   - Run the align_lyrics.py tool which handles everything in one step:
   ```bash
   python align_lyrics.py sequence_projects/song_name/artist_song_name.mp3 sequence_projects/song_name/lyrics.txt sequence_projects/song_name/lyrics_timestamps.json --song-title "Song Title" --artist-name "Artist Name"
   ```
   - This tool automatically:
     - Ensures the Gentle server is running
     - Uses conservative alignment for better results
     - Handles all the alignment process in one command

4. **Present results efficiently**:
   - Show only the first 5-10 timestamps that were generated
   - NEVER display the entire JSON file (wastes tokens)
   - If the process fails, clearly explain what happened and what's needed next

### ALTERNATIVE APPROACH: Using extract_lyrics.py

Only use this approach if align_lyrics.py is not available:

1. **Check Prerequisites First**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Check if the Gentle Docker container is running before attempting lyrics alignment
   - If not running, start it immediately with: `python -m sequence_maker.scripts.start_gentle`

2. **Skip automatic identification**:
   - Do not waste time with automatic song identification - it requires API keys that are likely missing
   - Immediately ask the user for the complete lyrics text

3. **Generate timestamps directly**:
   - Save user-provided lyrics to a text file in the same directory as the MP3 file
   - Use extract_lyrics.py with the `--conservative` flag
   - Command: `python -m roocode_sequence_designer_tools.extract_lyrics sequence_projects/song_name/artist_song_name.mp3 --lyrics-file sequence_projects/song_name/lyrics.txt --output sequence_projects/song_name/lyrics_timestamps.json --conservative`

## Token Efficiency Guidelines

1. **Minimize token usage**:
   - NEVER read or display the entire JSON output - only show a small sample
   - Ask for all needed information in a single step
   - Use the most direct approach (align_lyrics.py) whenever possible

2. **Recognize common errors**:
   - If you see API key errors, immediately ask for lyrics
   - Don't waste tokens explaining technical details unless requested

3. **Optimize workflow**:
   - Start Gentle server first
   - Use align_lyrics.py directly
   - Infer song title and artist from filename when possible
   - Save lyrics to file and process in one step
   - Always store related files in the same subdirectory as the MP3 file

## Self-Improvement Mechanism

After completing any task:

1. **Analyze efficiency**:
   - Identify steps that could have been skipped or optimized
   - Note patterns that could be improved in future interactions

2. **Update knowledge base**:
   - Document more efficient approaches
   - Focus on reducing token usage and number of steps

3. **Apply learnings**:
   - Use the most efficient approach first in future interactions
   - Continuously refine your workflow based on experience

## Pattern Templates

Pattern Templates are a powerful feature that allows you to define high-level, parameterized "meta-effects" that get expanded into multiple concrete effects. This is especially useful for creating sophisticated sequences with minimal manual work.

### When to Use Pattern Templates

1. **Repetitive Lyric-Based Effects**: When you want the same effect to occur on every instance of a word
2. **Warning Systems**: When you want preview effects before main events
3. **Beat Synchronization**: When you want effects synchronized with audio beats
4. **Complex Patterns**: When manual effect creation would be tedious and error-prone

### Available Pattern Types

1. **WarningThenEvent**: Creates warning effects before main events
2. **LyricHighlight**: Highlights specific words with visual effects
3. **BeatSync**: Synchronizes effects with audio beats

### Pattern Templates Workflow

1. **Design Phase**: Add pattern templates to the `pattern_templates` array in your `.seqdesign.json`
2. **Expansion Phase**: Use the pattern templates tool to expand into concrete effects
3. **Compilation Phase**: Compile the expanded file normally

```bash
# Expand pattern templates
python -m roocode_sequence_designer_tools.pattern_templates \
    input.seqdesign.json \
    expanded.seqdesign.json \
    --lyrics-file lyrics.synced_lyrics.json

# Compile as usual
python -m roocode_sequence_designer_tools.compile_seqdesign \
    expanded.seqdesign.json \
    output.prg.json
```

### Example Pattern Template

```json
{
  "pattern_templates": [
    {
      "id": "love_word_warnings",
      "pattern_type": "WarningThenEvent",
      "description": "Yellow warning before red 'love' words",
      "params": {
        "trigger_type": "lyric",
        "trigger_lyric": "love",
        "warning_offset_seconds": -0.5,
        "target_ball_selection_strategy": "round_robin",
        "event_definition": {
          "type": "solid_color",
          "params": {"color": {"name": "red"}, "duration_seconds": 0.4}
        },
        "warning_definition": {
          "type": "solid_color",
          "params": {"color": {"name": "yellow"}, "duration_seconds": 0.2}
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## File Organization Examples

### Correct Organization

```
sequence_projects/
└── you_know_me/
    ├── lubalin_you_know_me.mp3
    ├── lyrics.txt
    ├── lyrics.json
    ├── you_know_me.ball.json
    ├── you_know_me.seqdesign.json
    └── you_know_me.prg.json
```

### Incorrect Organization

```
sequence_projects/you_know_me/lubalin_you_know_me.mp3
lyrics.txt                    # In root directory
lyrics.json                   # In root directory
you_know_me.ball.json         # In root directory
```

Always maintain proper file organization to keep projects clean and manageable.
