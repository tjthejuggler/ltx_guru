**Task:** Create a single-ball sequence with a specific Red-Blue color cycle and off-states between words. Audio "one to ten", lyrics provided.

**Observation:** The existing tool [`roocode_sequence_designer_tools/apply_rgb_cycling_and_off_states.py`](roocode_sequence_designer_tools/apply_rgb_cycling_and_off_states.py) provided RGB cycling. The user requested R-B cycling.

**Action Taken:** Modified the `colors` list within [`roocode_sequence_designer_tools/apply_rgb_cycling_and_off_states.py`](roocode_sequence_designer_tools/apply_rgb_cycling_and_off_states.py) directly to `[[255, 0, 0], [0, 0, 255]]` to achieve the desired Red-Blue cycle. This was a quick and effective modification for this specific request.

**Reflection:**
*   **Efficiency:** Modifying the existing script was more efficient than creating a new one from scratch or manually editing the JSON for a two-color cycle.
*   **Tool Reusability:** The script `apply_rgb_cycling_and_off_states.py` is designed for a fixed RGB cycle. If more flexible color cycling (e.g., user-defined colors, different cycle lengths) becomes a common request, the tool could be enhanced to accept color patterns as command-line arguments. This would avoid repeated direct script modifications.
*   **Process Adherence:** The workflow correctly prioritized using existing tools and modifying one when it was close to the required functionality, as per the `sequence_designer_mode_instructions.md`.

**Potential Future Improvement (Tool Enhancement):**
*   Consider enhancing `apply_rgb_cycling_and_off_states.py` (or creating a new, more general tool) to accept a list of colors as a command-line argument (e.g., `--colors "255,0,0;0,0,255;0,255,0"`). This would make it more versatile for various color cycling patterns without needing code changes for each new pattern. This could be delegated to Code mode if deemed a high-priority reusable feature.
