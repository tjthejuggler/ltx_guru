Hello,

Here you can find everything you need to start with your prop.

There are sample projects, images, Software and manuals.

Copy and run the LighTriX Editor for PC. For MAC, you need to mount the dmg image.
Rememmber that you need your system to allow installation of our software /it is not yet registered with Microsoft or Apple/

Please copy the images to your harddrive, then you can locate them in lightrix Editor to use them in your projects.

LTX_Remote is remote control app - you can use it on Android, Windows or OSX.
Android apk file needs to be copied into your phone/tablet and runned - you need to allow the system to install it.
OSX dmg image needs to be mounted - same way like LighTriX Editor.
For Windows, please unzip the file in one directory and run the exe file.

Have Fun,

Vojtech
LighTriX Team
