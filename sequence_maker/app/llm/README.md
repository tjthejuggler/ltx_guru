## Components

### LLMManager

The main orchestrator class that coordinates all other components. It handles:
- Initialization of all components
- Request dispatching
- Signal emission
- Thread management
- Version history integration

### LLMConfig

Manages LLM configuration and profiles, including:
- Loading and saving profiles
- Profile switching
- Legacy settings migration

### LLMToolManager

Manages function definitions and execution, including:
- Function definitions for timeline, audio, and lyrics
- Function call handling
- Action registration and execution
- Tool implementation and execution

For detailed documentation on the tool system, including how to define, register, and implement new tools, see [LLM_TOOL_SYSTEM.md](./LLM_TOOL_SYSTEM.md).

### LLMResponseProcessor

Processes and parses LLM responses, including:
- Text extraction
- Ambiguity detection
- Suggestion extraction
- Action parsing
- Color sequence parsing

### LLMTracker

Tracks token usage, costs, and performance metrics, including:
- Token counting
- Cost calculation
- Performance metrics logging
- Project metadata updates

### API Clients

Provider-specific API clients that implement the BaseLLMClient interface:
- OpenAIClient: For OpenAI API (GPT-3.5, GPT-4)
- AnthropicClient: For Anthropic API (Claude)
- LocalClient: For local LLM models

## Usage

```python
from app.llm import LLMManager

# Create an instance
llm_manager = LLMManager(app)

# Send a request
llm_manager.send_request(
    prompt="Generate a color sequence for a juggling ball",
    system_message="You are a helpful assistant for creating juggling light sequences.",
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=1024,
    use_functions=True,
    stream=False
)

# Connect to signals
llm_manager.llm_response_received.connect(handle_response)
llm_manager.llm_error.connect(handle_error)
```

## Documentation

The LLM integration includes the following documentation:

- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the LLM integration components
- **REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md**: Summary of the refactoring process from the monolithic structure to the component-based architecture
- **LLM_TOOL_SYSTEM.md**: Detailed documentation of the tool system, including how to define, register, and implement new tools

## Migration from Legacy Structure

The LLM integration has been refactored from a monolithic class into smaller, focused components. If you were previously using `LLMManager` from `managers.llm_manager`, you should update your imports to use `app.llm.LLMManager` instead.

For backward compatibility, the old import path still works but will show a deprecation warning.
