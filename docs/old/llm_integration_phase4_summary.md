# LLM Integration Phase 4: Function Calling Implementation

This document summarizes the implementation of function calling in the LLM integration for Sequence Maker.

## 1. Overview

Function calling allows the LLM to directly invoke specific functions in the application, providing a more structured way to interact with the application's features. This implementation includes:

1. OpenAI function calling support
2. Structured function schemas for timeline and audio operations
3. Streaming response support
4. Enhanced UI for displaying function calls
5. Diagnostics tools for monitoring LLM performance

## 2. Components Implemented

### 2.1. LLM Manager Enhancements

- Added function calling support to the OpenAI API requests
- Implemented function schemas for timeline and audio operations
- Added streaming response support
- Added function call handling and execution
- Enhanced logging and performance metrics tracking

### 2.2. UI Enhancements

- Updated LLM chat window to display function calls in a structured format
- Added streaming response support to the chat window
- Created LLM diagnostics dialog for viewing performance metrics and token usage

### 2.3. Testing

- Added tests for function calling implementation
- Added tests for streaming responses
- Added tests for LLM diagnostics dialog

## 3. Function Schemas

### 3.1. Timeline Functions

- `create_segment`: Create a new segment in a timeline
- `delete_segment`: Delete a segment from a timeline
- `modify_segment`: Modify an existing segment in a timeline
- `clear_timeline`: Clear all segments from a timeline
- `create_segments_batch`: Create multiple segments in a timeline in a single operation

### 3.2. Audio Functions

- `play_audio`: Play the loaded audio file
- `pause_audio`: Pause audio playback
- `stop_audio`: Stop audio playback
- `seek_audio`: Seek to a specific position in the audio

## 4. Performance Metrics

The implementation includes comprehensive performance metrics tracking:

- Response time measurement
- Token usage tracking
- Cost estimation
- Tokens per second calculation
- Characters per second calculation

These metrics are displayed in the LLM diagnostics dialog, which provides insights into the LLM's performance and helps optimize the integration.

## 5. Next Steps

The next phase of the LLM integration will focus on:

1. Enhanced error handling and recovery
2. Multi-turn conversation context management
3. User preference integration for LLM behavior
4. Advanced audio analysis integration for better music-driven suggestions
