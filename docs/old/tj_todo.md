when i have two blocks, i need an easy way to put a new block in between them. maybe a easy way to press a key and choose a color, like shift+q is a fill command for red or something based on where the current position marker is. also, an llm tool could do this.

add in this new stuff that gemini suggested in geminis_advanced_music_ideas.md
