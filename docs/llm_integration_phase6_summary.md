# LLM Integration Phase 6: User Customization

This document summarizes the implementation of Phase 6 of the LLM integration for Sequence Maker, which focuses on User Customization.

## Overview

Phase 6 adds user customization features to the LLM integration, allowing users to:

1. Define custom instructions for the LLM
2. Create and manage LLM configuration presets
3. Use task templates for common operations
4. Easily switch between different configurations

These features enhance the user experience by providing more control over the LLM's behavior and making it easier to perform common tasks.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Custom Instructions

- Created `CustomInstructionsDialog` class for editing custom LLM instructions
- Updated `Project` model to store custom instructions
- Enhanced `LLMChatWindow` to include custom instructions in system messages
- Added button to access custom instructions from the chat window

### 2. LLM Presets

- Created `LLMPreset` class to represent LLM configuration presets
- Implemented `LLMPresetsDialog` for managing presets
- Updated `SettingsDialog` to provide access to preset management
- Enhanced `LLMChatWindow` to support preset selection
- Added preset selection to the chat window UI

### 3. Task Templates

- Created `LLMTaskTemplate` class to represent task templates
- Implemented `TaskTemplatesDialog` for managing templates
- Added template selection to the chat window UI
- Enhanced `LLMChatWindow` to apply selected templates

### 4. UI Enhancements

- Updated `LLMChatWindow` UI to include preset and template selection
- Added buttons for accessing customization features
- Enhanced `SettingsDialog` with customization options
- Implemented loading and saving of customization data

## Files Modified

1. `sequence_maker/models/project.py`
   - Added fields for storing custom instructions, presets, and templates
   - Updated serialization methods to include customization data

2. `sequence_maker/ui/dialogs/llm_chat_window.py`
   - Added UI elements for preset and template selection
   - Enhanced system message creation to include custom instructions
   - Added methods for loading and applying presets and templates

3. `sequence_maker/ui/dialogs/settings_dialog.py`
   - Added buttons for managing presets and custom instructions
   - Added handlers for customization dialogs

## Files Created

1. `sequence_maker/models/llm_customization.py`
   - Implemented `LLMPreset` class
   - Implemented `LLMTaskTemplate` class
   - Added functions for creating default presets and templates

2. `sequence_maker/ui/dialogs/custom_instructions_dialog.py`
   - Implemented dialog for editing custom instructions

3. `sequence_maker/ui/dialogs/llm_presets_dialog.py`
   - Implemented dialog for managing LLM presets

4. `sequence_maker/ui/dialogs/task_templates_dialog.py`
   - Implemented dialog for managing task templates

5. `sequence_maker/tests/test_llm_customization.py`
   - Added tests for customization features

## Usage Examples

### Custom Instructions

Users can define custom instructions that will be included in the system message sent to the LLM:

```
Always use RGB colors in the format [R, G, B]
Prefer creating patterns that match the mood of the music
Use color theory principles when suggesting color combinations
```

### LLM Presets

Users can create and select presets with different configurations:

- **Default**: Standard configuration (temperature: 0.7, max_tokens: 1024)
- **Creative**: Higher temperature for more creative responses (temperature: 1.0)
- **Precise**: Lower temperature for more deterministic responses (temperature: 0.3)

### Task Templates

Users can create and select templates for common tasks:

- **Create Beat-Synchronized Pattern**: Creates a pattern that changes on every beat
- **Create Mood-Based Sequence**: Creates a sequence based on the mood of the music
- **Create Rainbow Cycle**: Creates a sequence that cycles through rainbow colors

## Next Steps

With the completion of Phase 6, all planned LLM integration features have been implemented. Future enhancements could include:

1. **Advanced Template System**: Allow templates with variables and conditional logic
2. **Collaborative Features**: Share presets and templates between users
3. **Integration with External APIs**: Connect to external services for enhanced capabilities
4. **Voice Input/Output**: Add speech recognition and synthesis for voice interaction
