Okay, this is an exciting and significantly more complex step! Moving from lyric synchronization to interpreting and reacting to the music itself requires a robust music analysis pipeline and well-designed tools for the LLM. The preference learning aspect adds another layer of sophistication.

Here's a detailed plan focusing on the necessary components, data structures, tools, and preference mechanisms, designed to be understood and implemented by your programmer LLM:

Goal: Enable the primary LLM (the "designer") to create musically relevant juggling ball color sequences based on pre-analyzed audio features, and allow it to learn and adapt to user preferences over time.

Core Concepts:

Offline Music Analysis: The LLM cannot directly "listen" to or analyze audio. We need a separate process (run once per song) to extract key musical features using dedicated libraries.

Structured Music Data: The extracted features must be stored in a structured format (JSON is ideal) that the LLM can easily query via tools.

LLM as the Creative Director: The LLM's role is to interpret user requests (e.g., "make it pulse with the beat," "calm during verses, energetic on chorus"), query the music data using tools, and then use the create_segment tool (or potentially new higher-level pattern tools) to build the sequence.

Preference Mechanism: User feedback needs to be captured, stored, and systematically fed back to the LLM during future design sessions to guide its creative choices.

Detailed Plan for Implementation:

Phase 1: Music Analysis Pipeline (Preprocessing)

Objective: Extract relevant musical features from the audio file before the LLM interaction begins.

Technology: Use a Python library designed for music information retrieval (MIR). librosa is the industry standard and highly recommended.

Process (To be implemented in your Python backend):

Load Audio: Load the song's audio file (e.g., MP3, WAV).

Extract Features: Use librosa functions to extract:

Tempo (BPM): Overall beats per minute (librosa.beat.tempo). Potentially estimate tempo changes if significant.

Beats: Precise timestamps of beat events (librosa.beat.beat_track).

Downbeats: Timestamps of beats likely corresponding to the start of measures (often derived from beat tracking or harmonic analysis). Can add emphasis.

Structural Segmentation: Estimate boundaries between sections like intro, verse, chorus, bridge, outro (librosa.segment.agglomerative or similar methods based on feature similarity like chroma or MFCCs). Label these sections (e.g., "Section A", "Section B" or attempt heuristic labeling like "Verse 1", "Chorus 1").

Onset Strength: A measure of "attack" or percussiveness over time (librosa.onset.onset_strength). Can identify sharp sounds or rhythmic hits.

RMS Energy (Loudness): Root Mean Square energy as a proxy for perceived loudness over time (librosa.feature.rms). Useful for dynamics.

Chroma Features: Represent harmonic content over time (librosa.feature.chroma_stft). Can potentially distinguish major/minor feel or chord changes, useful for advanced color mapping.

Spectral Contrast: Measures the difference between peaks and valleys in the spectrum, related to textural clarity (librosa.feature.spectral_contrast).

Store Analysis Results: Save all extracted features into a well-structured JSON file associated with the song.

Example song_analysis.json Structure:

{
  "song_title": "Example Song",
  "duration_seconds": 245.6,
  "estimated_tempo": 120.5,
  "time_signature_guess": "4/4", // Can be hard, maybe omit or keep basic
  "beats": [0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, ...], // Timestamps in seconds
  "downbeats": [0.5, 2.5, 4.5, ...], // Timestamps in seconds
  "sections": [
    {"label": "Intro", "start": 0.0, "end": 15.2},
    {"label": "Verse 1", "start": 15.2, "end": 45.8},
    {"label": "Chorus 1", "start": 45.8, "end": 75.1},
    {"label": "Verse 2", "start": 75.1, "end": 105.5},
    {"label": "Chorus 2", "start": 105.5, "end": 135.0},
    {"label": "Bridge", "start": 135.0, "end": 160.0},
    {"label": "Chorus 3", "start": 160.0, "end": 190.0},
    {"label": "Outro", "start": 190.0, "end": 245.6}
  ],
  "energy_timeseries": { // Optional: Sampled representation
    "times": [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, ...],
    "values": [0.1, 0.12, 0.15, ...] // Normalized RMS values
  },
  "onset_strength_timeseries": { // Optional: Sampled representation
     "times": [0.0, 0.05, 0.1, ...], // Higher time resolution often needed
     "values": [0.01, 0.05, 0.8, ...] // Peak values indicate onsets
  },
  "significant_events": [ // Optional: Can be curated manually or via algorithms
      {"label": "Drop", "time": 45.8},
      {"label": "Build-up Start", "time": 155.0},
      {"label": "Silence", "time": 188.0, "duration": 1.5}
  ]
  // Add other features like chroma, spectral contrast if extracted
}


Phase 2: LLM Tools for Accessing Music Data

Objective: Give the LLM the ability to query the pre-analyzed song_analysis.json data without overwhelming its context window.

Implementation: Create new functions available as tools to the LLM. These functions read the relevant parts of the JSON file.

Required Tools:

get_song_metadata()

Description: "Retrieves general metadata about the current song, including duration, estimated tempo, and a list of identified sections (like intro, verse, chorus) with their labels and approximate start/end times."

Arguments: None

Returns: JSON object with keys like duration_seconds, estimated_tempo, sections (list of {"label", "start", "end"}).

get_beats_in_range(start_time, end_time, beat_type='all')

Description: "Fetches the precise timestamps of musical beats within a specified time range (in seconds). Can optionally filter for 'all' beats, only 'downbeats', or potentially other beat subdivisions if analyzed."

Arguments:

start_time (float, required): Start of the time range.

end_time (float, required): End of the time range.

beat_type (string, optional, default='all'): Type of beat ('all', 'downbeat').

Returns: JSON object like {"success": true, "beats": [timestamp1, timestamp2, ...]}.

get_section_details(section_label)

Description: "Provides the precise start and end times for a specific section identified by its label (e.g., 'Chorus 1', 'Verse 2'). Use get_song_metadata first to see available section labels."

Arguments:

section_label (string, required): The label of the section (must match one from get_song_metadata).

Returns: JSON object like {"success": true, "label": "Chorus 1", "start": 45.8, "end": 75.1} or {"success": false, "message": "Section not found"}.

(Optional) get_feature_value_at_time(time, feature_name)

Description: "Retrieves the estimated value of a specific musical feature (e.g., 'energy', 'onset_strength') at a given point in time."

Arguments:

time (float, required): The timestamp to query.

feature_name (string, required): The feature to retrieve ('energy', 'onset_strength', etc. - depends on what's in the JSON).

Returns: JSON object like {"success": true, "time": 30.5, "feature": "energy", "value": 0.65}.

(Optional) get_significant_events()

Description: "Retrieves a list of specifically marked significant musical events like drops, builds, or silences and their timestamps."

Arguments: None

Returns: JSON object like {"success": true, "events": [{"label": "Drop", "time": 45.8}, ...]}.

Keep Existing Tool: create_segment(ball_index, start_time, end_time, color, [optional: effect]) - This remains the fundamental building block for applying color changes. You might enhance it with simple effects (e.g., "flash", "pulse", "fade_in").

Phase 3: Designing Higher-Level Pattern Tools (Optional but Recommended)

Objective: Simplify common music synchronization tasks for the LLM. Instead of calculating dozens of create_segment calls for a beat pattern, the LLM calls one high-level tool.

Implementation: Create more complex tools that internally use the data-access tools and call create_segment multiple times.

Example High-Level Tools:

apply_beat_pattern(section_label=None, start_time=None, end_time=None, beat_type='all', pattern_type='pulse', color='white', balls='all', pulse_duration=0.1)

Description: "Applies a rhythmic color pattern synchronized to beats within a given section or time range. Example patterns: 'pulse' (short flash on beat), 'toggle' (switch color on beat)."

Arguments: Define section or time range, beat type, pattern details (color, duration), target balls.

Internal Logic: Gets section times if needed, gets beats in range, calculates create_segment calls based on pattern_type, color, pulse_duration, etc.

apply_section_theme(section_label, base_color, energy_map='brightness', balls='all')

Description: "Applies a consistent color theme to a section, potentially modulating brightness or saturation based on the song's energy/loudness within that section."

Arguments: Section label, base color, how to map energy (e.g., 'brightness', 'saturation'), target balls.

Internal Logic: Gets section times, gets energy timeseries for the section, creates one or more long create_segment calls, possibly with color/brightness modulation (requires create_segment to support this or creates many small segments).

Phase 4: Preference Learning Mechanism

Objective: Allow the LLM to improve designs based on user feedback.

Components:

Feedback Input: A way for the user to provide feedback after a pattern is generated or previewed. This could be:

Natural Language: "I loved the pulsing blue on the first chorus, but the transition into the verse was too sudden."

Structured Ratings: Rate aspects (e.g., Section Sync: 5/5, Color Choice: 3/5, Transitions: 2/5).

Direct Edits: Allow user to manually tweak the generated segments (complex).

Preference Storage: A simple database (like SQLite) or even a structured text/JSON file to store preferences. Each entry should link:

song_id (identifier for the song)

pattern_id (optional, identifier for the specific generated sequence)

timestamp_context (optional, e.g., "Chorus 1", or a time range)

feedback_text (the raw user feedback)

feedback_sentiment (positive/negative/neutral - can be LLM-classified or user-selected)

feedback_tags (optional, e.g., ["beat sync", "color choice", "transition", "chorus"]) - LLM could help generate these.

creation_timestamp

Preference Retrieval & Injection:

Before the LLM starts designing a new pattern (or revising an existing one), retrieve relevant past feedback from the storage.

Relevance Criteria: Prioritize feedback for the same song, then feedback with similar tags (e.g., "chorus", "beat sync"), then more general feedback.

Summarization: Use another LLM call (or simple filtering) to summarize the most relevant N pieces of feedback into concise points.

Injection: Include this summary in the system prompt or as a message at the start of the conversation for the designer LLM. Example:

System Prompt Addition:
---
User Preference Summary (Apply these guidelines where appropriate):
- Likes: Pulsing effects on beats during choruses (e.g., 'blue pulse' mentioned positively for Song X Chorus 1).
- Likes: Smooth, slow color fades during verses.
- Dislikes: Abrupt color changes between sections, especially verse-to-chorus. Prefers short fades or overlaps.
- Prefers: Using brighter colors (yellows, oranges) for high-energy sections.
- Avoid: Strobing effects during quiet bridges.
---
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

LLM's Role: The designer LLM uses this injected preference summary, alongside the current user request and the music analysis data (via tools), to make more informed decisions when calling create_segment or the higher-level pattern tools.

Workflow Example (Putting it Together):

User selects "Example Song".

Backend ensures example_song_analysis.json exists (runs analysis if not).

Backend retrieves relevant preference summary for "Example Song" and general preferences.

Conversation starts, LLM gets the preference summary in its initial context.

User: "Make the colors pulse with the beat during the choruses, maybe using blues and greens. Keep the verses calmer with slow fades."

LLM (Thinking):

Okay, need chorus times and verse times. Use get_song_metadata. -> Gets section list.

User wants beat pulsing in choruses. Need beat times for 'Chorus 1', 'Chorus 2', etc. Use get_beats_in_range for each chorus start/end time.

User mentioned blues/greens for chorus. Preference summary says 'pulsing effects on beats during choruses' are liked. Good.

User wants calmer verses with slow fades. Preference summary likes 'slow fades during verses'. Good.

Need to apply the patterns. Can use apply_beat_pattern for choruses and apply_section_theme (or manual create_segment calls with fades) for verses.

LLM (Executing):

Calls get_song_metadata().

Calls apply_beat_pattern(section_label='Chorus 1', pattern_type='pulse', color='blue', ...).

Calls apply_beat_pattern(section_label='Chorus 2', pattern_type='pulse', color='green', ...).

Calls apply_section_theme(section_label='Verse 1', base_color='cyan', effect='slow_fade', ...).

Calls apply_section_theme(section_label='Verse 2', base_color='darkblue', effect='slow_fade', ...).

(Handles transitions based on preferences/defaults).

Assistant generates the pattern file via tool calls.

User provides feedback: "The green pulse on Chorus 2 was great! The Verse 1 cyan fade felt a bit too fast though."

Backend stores this feedback linked to the song/pattern. The next time the LLM designs for this song or uses fades, this feedback will be considered.

This comprehensive plan provides the necessary structure for your programmer LLM to build a sophisticated, musically aware, and preference-learning juggling pattern designer. Remember to start simple (e.g., just beats and sections) and incrementally add more features and tools.

*AT THIS POINT THE PLAN-MAKER WAS GIVEN SPECIFIC DOCUMENTATION ON OUR PROJECT*


Okay, excellent! Having the READMEs and tool system documentation for `Sequence_Maker` provides a concrete foundation. We can now tailor the previous general advice specifically to your application's structure (`app/llm/tool_manager.py`, `managers/`, etc.).

Here's a detailed, customized plan for integrating music-based generation and preference learning into `Sequence_Maker`, designed for your programmer LLM:

**Overall Goal:** Enhance `Sequence_Maker`'s LLM capabilities to:
1.  Generate color sequences synchronized with musical features (beats, sections, energy) extracted via `librosa`.
2.  Learn and adapt to user preferences regarding generated sequences over time.

**Phase 1: Enhanced Music Analysis Pipeline**

*   **Objective:** Generate a comprehensive `song_analysis.json` file containing detailed musical features for the currently loaded audio file.
*   **Location:** This logic should reside *outside* the `app/llm/` directory as it's a core data processing step.
    *   **Recommendation:** Create a new manager, e.g., `managers/audio_analysis_manager.py`.
    *   Instantiate this manager within your main application class (`app` instance likely passed around) so it can be triggered and its results accessed.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    1.  **`AudioAnalysisManager` Class:**
        *   Takes the main `app` instance or necessary configuration on initialization.
        *   Method: `analyze_audio(audio_file_path)`:
            *   Loads the audio using `librosa.load()`.
            *   Extracts features using `librosa`:
                *   `librosa.beat.tempo` -> `estimated_tempo`
                *   `librosa.beat.beat_track` -> `beats` (timestamps)
                *   **NEW:** Derive `downbeats`: Often the first beat of every N beats based on time signature (e.g., every 4 beats in 4/4). Requires logic after `beat_track`. Store as `downbeats` (timestamps).
                *   **NEW:** `librosa.segment.agglomerative` or `librosa.feature.stack_memory` with chroma/MFCCs -> `sections` (list of `{"label": "auto_label", "start": float, "end": float}`). Implement a simple labeling strategy (e.g., "A", "B", "A", "C" or "Verse", "Chorus" heuristically based on length/position).
                *   `librosa.feature.rms` -> `energy_timeseries` (times and normalized values).
                *   `librosa.onset.onset_strength` -> `onset_strength_timeseries` (times and values).
                *   **(Optional Advanced):** `librosa.feature.chroma_stft`, `librosa.feature.spectral_contrast`.
            *   Formats results into the structured `song_analysis.json` (as defined previously).
            *   Saves the JSON file. **Storage Location:** Associate it clearly with the audio file or project. Options:
                *   Save next to the project file (`.smkr`?) with a derived name (e.g., `my_project.song_analysis.json`).
                *   Save in a dedicated subdirectory within the project location.
                *   Save in the application's config/cache directory (`~/.config/SequenceMaker/analysis_cache/`) using a hash of the audio path as the filename.
                *   **Crucially:** The main application state must track the path to the *current* song's analysis JSON.
    2.  **Triggering Analysis:**
        *   In the UI code that handles `File > Load Audio`, after successfully loading audio, call `audio_analysis_manager.analyze_audio(audio_path)`.
        *   Run this analysis in a background thread (e.g., using `QThread`) to avoid freezing the UI. Provide UI feedback (e.g., status bar message "Analyzing audio...").
        *   Store the path to the generated analysis file in the application's current project/state data.
    3.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere to the detailed structure proposed previously, including `beats`, `downbeats`, `sections`, `energy_timeseries`, etc.

**Phase 2: LLM Tools for Accessing Music Data**

*   **Objective:** Create new tools within the existing LLM framework (`LLMToolManager`) for the LLM to query the `song_analysis.json` data.
*   **Location:** All definitions, handlers, and registration occur within `app/llm/tool_manager.py`.
*   **Implementation Steps (Follow `LLM_TOOL_SYSTEM.md` process):**

    1.  **Define Tool Schemas:** Add these JSON definitions to the `audio_functions` property in `LLMToolManager`.
        *   `get_song_metadata`: (As defined before: duration, tempo, sections list).
        *   `get_beats_in_range`: (As defined before: requires `start_time`, `end_time`, optional `beat_type='all'|'downbeat'`). *Consider if this replaces or enhances the existing `get_beat_info`.* If `get_beat_info` is very basic, deprecate it or modify it. A ranged query is more flexible.
        *   `get_section_details`: (As defined before: requires `section_label`, returns start/end).
        *   `(Optional)` `get_feature_value_at_time`: (As defined before: requires `time`, `feature_name`).
        *   `(Optional)` `get_significant_events`: (As defined before: useful if analysis produces these).

    2.  **Implement Handler Methods:** Add corresponding private methods within `LLMToolManager` (e.g., `_handle_get_song_metadata`, `_handle_get_beats_in_range`).
        *   **Accessing Data:** These handlers need the path to the current `song_analysis.json`. The `LLMToolManager` likely has access to the main `app` instance (`self.app`). Add a method to the `app` or a relevant state manager to get the current analysis file path.
        *   **Logic:** Each handler should:
            *   Get the analysis file path.
            *   Load the JSON data (`json.load(file)`). Handle file-not-found errors gracefully (return error to LLM).
            *   Extract the specific data requested by the tool parameters (e.g., filter beats within the time range, find the section by label).
            *   Validate parameters (e.g., check if `beat_type` is valid).
            *   Return the result in the standard structured format (`{"success": True/False, ...}`).

    3.  **Register Handlers:** In `LLMToolManager.__init__`, add calls to `self.register_action_handler("new_tool_name", self._handle_new_tool_name)` for each new audio tool.

**Phase 3: Higher-Level Pattern Tools (Recommended)**

*   **Objective:** Simplify common musical pattern generation tasks for the LLM.
*   **Location:** Define, implement, and register within `app/llm/tool_manager.py`.
*   **Implementation Steps:**

    1.  **Define Tool Schemas:** Add to `timeline_functions` or a new `pattern_functions` category in `LLMToolManager`.
        *   `apply_beat_pattern`: (As defined before: section/time range, beat_type, pattern_type='pulse'|'toggle'|..., color, balls, pulse_duration).
        *   `apply_section_theme`: (As defined before: section_label, base_color, energy_map='brightness'|'saturation'|'none', balls).

    2.  **Implement Handler Methods:** Add `_handle_apply_beat_pattern`, `_handle_apply_section_theme`.
        *   **Core Logic:** These handlers will be more complex. They should:
            *   Retrieve necessary musical data by *directly reading the `song_analysis.json`* (preferred over chaining LLM tool calls). Get the analysis file path as described in Phase 2.
            *   Calculate the required segment timings and colors based on the pattern logic (e.g., loop through beats, calculate pulse start/end times).
            *   **Crucially:** Interact with the core application logic to create the segments on the timeline. Instead of calling `_handle_create_segment` (which adds complexity), directly use the underlying methods that `_handle_create_segment` uses. This might involve accessing `self.app.timeline_manager` or similar core components responsible for manipulating the sequence data model. Ensure these interactions trigger necessary UI updates (e.g., via signals if using PyQt).
            *   Return a summary result (`{"success": True, "message": "Applied pulse pattern to Chorus 1..."}`).

    3.  **Register Handlers:** Register these new pattern handlers in `LLMToolManager.__init__`.

**Phase 4: Preference Learning Mechanism**

*   **Objective:** Store user feedback and inject summaries into the LLM context to guide future designs.
*   **Implementation:**

    1.  **Feedback Input (UI):**
        *   **Location:** Modify UI files in the `ui/` directory, specifically around the LLM chat dialog (`Tools > LLM Chat`) or the main timeline view.
        *   **Components:** Add simple "Like" / "Dislike" buttons, potentially a text field for comments, after the LLM generates or modifies a sequence.

    2.  **Preference Storage:**
        *   **Location:** Create a new manager: `managers/preference_manager.py`.
        *   **Technology:** Use Python's built-in `sqlite3` module.
        *   **Database:** Create `preferences.db` in the application's config directory (e.g., `~/.config/SequenceMaker/preferences.db`).
        *   **`PreferenceManager` Class:**
            *   `__init__`: Connects to the DB, creates the table if it doesn't exist (schema: `id`, `song_identifier` TEXT, `timestamp` REAL, `feedback_text` TEXT, `sentiment` INTEGER (e.g., 1=positive, -1=negative), `tags` TEXT (JSON list), `created_at` TEXT).
            *   `add_feedback(...)`: Method called by the UI when feedback is submitted. Stores the feedback in the DB. Could potentially use the LLM to auto-tag feedback based on keywords (`beat sync`, `color`, `transition`, `verse`, `chorus`).
            *   `get_preference_summary(current_song_identifier, max_items=5)`: Retrieves relevant feedback. Prioritizes feedback for `current_song_identifier`, then potentially general feedback (e.g., where `song_identifier` is NULL or 'general'). Formats it into a concise text summary string.

    3.  **Preference Retrieval & Injection:**
        *   **Location:** Modify `app/llm/llm_manager.py`.
        *   **Logic:**
            *   In `LLMManager`, ensure it has access to the `PreferenceManager` instance and the `current_song_identifier`.
            *   Modify the `send_request` method (or wherever the request is prepared).
            *   *Before* calling the LLM API client (`openai_client`, `anthropic_client`, etc.):
                *   Call `preference_manager.get_preference_summary(current_song_identifier)`.
                *   Prepend the returned summary string to the `system_message` being sent to the LLM. Example:
                    ```python
                    preference_summary = self.preference_manager.get_preference_summary(song_id)
                    if preference_summary:
                        final_system_message = f"User Preference Summary:\n{preference_summary}\n---\nOriginal System Prompt:\n{system_message}"
                    else:
                        final_system_message = system_message
                    # ... pass final_system_message to the API client
                    ```

    4.  **LLM Instruction:** Ensure the base system prompt (configured possibly via `LLMConfig`) informs the LLM to pay attention to the "User Preference Summary" section if present and use it to guide its creative choices and tool usage.

**Summary for Programmer LLM:**

1.  **Implement `AudioAnalysisManager`:** Create `managers/audio_analysis_manager.py` using `librosa` to extract beats, *downbeats*, *sections*, energy, and onsets. Save results to a `song_analysis.json` associated with the project/audio file. Trigger analysis in the background on audio load.
2.  **Add Audio Data Tools:** In `app/llm/tool_manager.py`, define, implement (`_handle_...`), and register tools (`get_song_metadata`, `get_beats_in_range`, `get_section_details`) to query the `song_analysis.json`. Handlers read the JSON.
3.  **Add Pattern Tools:** In `app/llm/tool_manager.py`, define, implement, and register higher-level tools (`apply_beat_pattern`, `apply_section_theme`). Handlers read analysis JSON and directly use core application logic (e.g., `TimelineManager`) to create multiple segments efficiently.
4.  **Implement `PreferenceManager`:** Create `managers/preference_manager.py` using `sqlite3` to store feedback (sentiment, text, tags) in `config_dir/preferences.db`. Include methods to add feedback and retrieve summarized preferences.
5.  **Integrate Preferences into LLM Flow:** Modify `app/llm/llm_manager.py` to call `PreferenceManager.get_preference_summary()` and prepend the result to the system message before sending requests to the LLM API.
6.  **Update UI:** Add simple UI elements (buttons, text field) for users to submit feedback on generated sequences. Connect these UI elements to `PreferenceManager.add_feedback()`.
7.  **Follow `LLM_TOOL_SYSTEM.md`:** Adhere strictly to the defined procedures for adding new tools.

This detailed, file-specific plan should give your programmer LLM clear instructions, leveraging the existing architecture while adding the desired new functionality. Start with Phase 1 and 2, then add Phase 3, and finally Phase 4 for an incremental approach.
