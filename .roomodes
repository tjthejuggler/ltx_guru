      "customInstructions": "LYRICS EXTRACTION WORKFLOW - HIGHEST PRIORITY:\n1. When extracting lyrics timestamps, ALWAYS follow this exact workflow:\n   a. First, start the Gentle server: `python -m sequence_maker.scripts.start_gentle`\n   b. Ask the user for the song name, artist, and complete lyrics text\n   c. Save the lyrics to a file: `write_to_file lyrics.txt [lyrics content]`\n   d. Use the direct alignment approach: `python -m roocode_sequence_designer_tools.extract_lyrics [audio_path] --lyrics-file lyrics.txt --output lyrics_timestamps.json --conservative`\n   e. If the above fails, use the direct Gentle API approach with the align_lyrics.py script below\n\n2. NEVER waste time with automatic song identification - it requires API keys that are likely missing\n3. ALWAYS use the `--conservative` flag when aligning user-provided lyrics\n4. If the standard tools fail, use this direct approach with the Gentle API:\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport json\nimport requests\n\ndef align_lyrics(audio_path, lyrics_path, output_path, conservative=True):\n    print(f\"Aligning audio: {audio_path}\")\n    print(f\"Using lyrics from: {lyrics_path}\")\n    \n    # Check if the Gentle server is running\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(\"http://localhost:8765\", timeout=2)\n        if response.status_code != 200:\n            print(f\"Gentle server returned status code {response.status_code}\")\n            return False\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error connecting to Gentle server: {e}\")\n        return False\n    \n    # Load the lyrics\n    try:\n        with open(lyrics_path, 'r') as f:\n            lyrics_text = f.read()\n        print(f\"Loaded lyrics ({len(lyrics_text)} characters)\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error loading lyrics: {e}\")\n        return False\n    \n    # Ensure audio path is absolute\n    audio_path = os.path.abspath(audio_path)\n    \n    # Send request to Gentle\n    try:\n        with open(audio_path, 'rb') as audio_file:\n            files = {\n                'audio': audio_file,\n                'transcript': (None, lyrics_text)\n            }\n            \n            # Build the URL with parameters\n            url = 'http://localhost:8765/transcriptions?async=false'\n            if conservative:\n                url += '&conservative=true'\n            \n            response = requests.post(\n                url,\n                files=files,\n                timeout=120\n            )\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error during alignment: {e}\")\n        return False\n    \n    # Parse response\n    try:\n        result = response.json()\n    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n        print(f\"Error parsing JSON response: {e}\")\n        return False\n    \n    # Extract word timestamps\n    word_timestamps = []\n    \n    for word in result.get('words', []):\n        if 'start' not in word or 'end' not in word:\n            continue\n        \n        word_timestamps.append({\n            'word': word.get('alignedWord', ''),\n            'start': word.get('start', 0.0),\n            'end': word.get('end', 0.0)\n        })\n    \n    # Create the output data\n    lyrics_data = {\n        \"song_title\": \"Song Title\",\n        \"artist_name\": \"Artist Name\",\n        \"raw_lyrics\": lyrics_text,\n        \"word_timestamps\": word_timestamps,\n        \"processing_status\": {\n            \"song_identified\": True,\n            \"lyrics_retrieved\": True,\n            \"lyrics_aligned\": len(word_timestamps) > 0,\n            \"user_assistance_needed\": False,\n            \"message\": \"Lyrics aligned successfully.\"\n        }\n    }\n    \n    # Save to file\n    with open(output_path, 'w') as f:\n        json.dump(lyrics_data, f, indent=2)\n    \n    return True\n```\n\nCRITICAL: When creating or modifying `.seqdesign.json` files, you MUST strictly adhere to the schema defined in `roocode_sequence_designer_tools/docs/seqdesign_json_schema.md`. This includes ensuring the correct top-level keys (e.g., 'metadata'), nested structures (e.g., 'timing' object within effects), and all required fields are present. Failure to do so will result in compilation errors.\n\n- Always verify the structure of the `.seqdesign.json` file against the schema before attempting to compile it.\n- Pay close attention to the 'metadata' object and its required fields like `target_prg_refresh_rate` and `default_pixels`.\n- Ensure each effect in the `effects_timeline` has a `type`, `timing` (with `start_seconds`, `end_seconds` or `duration_seconds`), and `params` object as per the schema.\n\nTOOL USAGE GUIDELINES:\n1. ALWAYS first search for existing tools in the roocode_sequence_designer_tools directory that can accomplish your task. DO NOT look in sequence_maker for tools.\n2. Specifically check for CLI tools like extract_audio_features.py and other utilities before creating new scripts.\n3. If you need to create a new tool because existing ones don't meet requirements:\n   - Place it in the appropriate location within roocode_sequence_designer_tools\n   - Document it thoroughly with clear usage examples\n   - Update tools_lookup.json if applicable to register the new tool\n   - Create appropriate tests for the new tool\n4. When creating new tools, ensure they follow the project's coding style and integrate with existing systems.\n5. Always document any new tools you create so future instances will know about them and not recreate them."
