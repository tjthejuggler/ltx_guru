      "customInstructions": "FILE ORGANIZATION:\n1. ALWAYS organize project files in the sequence_projects directory using the following structure:\n   ```\n   sequence_projects/\n   └── song_name/                # Create a subdirectory for each song\n       ├── artist_song_name.mp3  # Original audio file\n       ├── lyrics.txt            # Raw lyrics text file\n       ├── lyrics_timestamps.json # Generated timestamps\n       ├── analysis_report.json  # Audio analysis data\n       └── song_name.seqdesign.json # Sequence design file\n   ```\n   This organization:\n   - Keeps all related files together\n   - Makes it easier to find and manage project files\n   - Prevents clutter in the root directory\n   - Simplifies backup and sharing of complete projects\n\nLYRICS EXTRACTION WORKFLOW - OPTIMIZED:\n1. When extracting lyrics timestamps, ALWAYS follow this exact workflow:\n   a. First, check if Gentle server is running: `python -m sequence_maker.scripts.start_gentle`\n   b. Use the direct align_lyrics.py approach (most efficient):\n      - Ask for lyrics text in a single step\n      - Save lyrics to a file in the same directory as the MP3 file: `write_to_file sequence_projects/song_name/lyrics.txt [lyrics content]`\n      - Run: `python align_lyrics.py sequence_projects/song_name/artist_song_name.mp3 sequence_projects/song_name/lyrics.txt sequence_projects/song_name/lyrics_timestamps.json --song-title \"[Title]\" --artist-name \"[Artist]\"`\n   c. When displaying results, DO NOT read the entire JSON file - only show the first 5-10 timestamps\n\n2. EFFICIENCY GUIDELINES:\n   - NEVER waste time with automatic song identification - it requires API keys that are likely missing\n   - ALWAYS use align_lyrics.py directly instead of extract_lyrics.py when possible\n   - NEVER include the full JSON output in responses - it wastes tokens\n   - If you see API key errors, immediately ask for lyrics instead of trying multiple approaches\n   - Song title and artist name can often be inferred from the filename\n   - ALWAYS check if tools already exist before creating new ones\n   - ALWAYS store related files in the same subdirectory as the MP3 file\n\n3. SELF-IMPROVEMENT MECHANISM:\n   - After completing any task, analyze what could have been done more efficiently\n   - Identify patterns that could be optimized in future interactions\n   - Update your knowledge base with these optimizations\n   - Focus on reducing token usage and number of steps required\n\nCRITICAL: When creating or modifying `.seqdesign.json` files, you MUST strictly adhere to the schema defined in `roocode_sequence_designer_tools/docs/seqdesign_json_schema.md`. This includes ensuring the correct top-level keys (e.g., 'metadata'), nested structures (e.g., 'timing' object within effects), and all required fields are present. Failure to do so will result in compilation errors.\n\n- Always verify the structure of the `.seqdesign.json` file against the schema before attempting to compile it.\n- Pay close attention to the 'metadata' object and its required fields like `target_prg_refresh_rate` and `default_pixels`.\n- Ensure each effect in the `effects_timeline` has a `type`, `timing` (with `start_seconds`, `end_seconds` or `duration_seconds`), and `params` object as per the schema.\n\nTOOL USAGE GUIDELINES:\n1. ALWAYS first search for existing tools in the roocode_sequence_designer_tools directory that can accomplish your task. DO NOT look in sequence_maker for tools.\n2. Specifically check for CLI tools like extract_audio_features.py and other utilities before creating new scripts.\n3. If you need to create a new tool because existing ones don't meet requirements:\n   - Place it in the appropriate location within roocode_sequence_designer_tools\n   - Document it thoroughly with clear usage examples\n   - Update tools_lookup.json if applicable to register the new tool\n   - Create appropriate tests for the new tool\n4. When creating new tools, ensure they follow the project's coding style and integrate with existing systems.\n5. Always document any new tools you create so future instances will know about them and not recreate them."
