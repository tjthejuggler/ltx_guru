# LTX Guru MCP Servers Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've successfully implemented two MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that extend the capabilities of AI assistants like Roo to work with audio analysis and color sequence generation:

1. **Audio Analyzer MCP Server**: Analyzes audio files to extract musical features like beats, sections, and energy levels.
2. **LTX Sequence Maker MCP Server**: Creates color sequences synchronized to music based on the analysis data.

## Implementation Details

### Audio Analyzer MCP Server

The Audio Analyzer MCP server provides the following tools:

- `analyze_audio`: Analyzes an audio file to extract musical features
- `get_song_metadata`: Gets general metadata about the analyzed song
- `get_beats_in_range`: Gets beat timestamps within a specified time range
- `get_section_details`: Gets details about a specific section of the song
- `get_feature_value_at_time`: Gets the value of a specific audio feature at a given time

This server uses librosa to perform comprehensive audio analysis, extracting features like:
- Beats and downbeats
- Song sections (Intro, Verse, Chorus, etc.)
- Energy levels
- Spectral features (chroma, spectral contrast, etc.)

### LTX Sequence Maker MCP Server

The LTX Sequence Maker MCP server provides the following tools:

- `apply_beat_pattern`: Applies a color pattern synchronized to beats
- `apply_section_theme`: Applies color themes to different sections of the song
- `create_color_sequence`: Creates a simple color sequence with alternating colors

This server supports various pattern types:
- Pulse: Short color segments at each beat
- Toggle: Alternating colors between beats
- Fade In: Segments that fade in from black to the target color
- Fade Out: Segments that fade out from the target color to black

It also supports energy mapping to color properties:
- Brightness: Maps energy to the brightness of colors
- Saturation: Maps energy to the saturation of colors

## Installation

Both MCP servers have been installed in the following locations:

- Audio Analyzer MCP: `/home/twain/.local/share/Roo-Code/MCP/audio_analyzer_mcp`
- LTX Sequence Maker MCP: `/home/twain/.local/share/Roo-Code/MCP/ltx_sequence_maker_mcp`

They have been registered in the MCP settings file at:
`/home/twain/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/mcp_settings.json`

To install the dependencies for both servers, run:

```bash
cd /home/twain/.local/share/Roo-Code/MCP/audio_analyzer_mcp
pip install -e .

cd /home/twain/.local/share/Roo-Code/MCP/ltx_sequence_maker_mcp
pip install -e .
```

## How to Use

1. **Start by analyzing an audio file**:
   ```python
   analysis_result = use_mcp_tool(
       server_name="audio-analyzer",
       tool_name="analyze_audio",
       arguments={
           "audio_file_path": "/path/to/your/audio.mp3"
       }
   )
   ```

2. **Get beats or sections from the analyzed data**:
   ```python
   beats_result = use_mcp_tool(
       server_name="audio-analyzer",
       tool_name="get_beats_in_range",
       arguments={
           "start_time": 0.0,
           "end_time": 30.0,
           "beat_type": "all"
       }
   )
   ```

3. **Create color patterns using the LTX Sequence Maker MCP**:
   ```python
   pattern_result = use_mcp_tool(
       server_name="ltx-sequence-maker",
       tool_name="apply_beat_pattern",
       arguments={
           "beats": beats_result["beats"],
           "pattern_type": "pulse",
           "colors": ["red", "green", "blue"],
           "duration": 0.25
       }
   )
   ```

4. **Use the generated segments in your application**:
   ```python
   segments = pattern_result["segments"]
   # Each segment has start_time, end_time, and color
   ```

## Documentation

For detailed documentation on how to use both MCP servers together, refer to:
`/home/twain/Projects/ltx_guru/mcp_servers_documentation.md`

This documentation includes:
- Detailed descriptions of all tools and their parameters
- Example workflows for creating music-synchronized color sequences
- Explanations of pattern types and energy mapping
- Troubleshooting tips

## Conclusion

The Audio Analyzer and LTX Sequence Maker MCP servers provide a powerful way to create music-synchronized color sequences. By analyzing audio files and applying various pattern types, you can create sophisticated light shows that match the rhythm and structure of music.

These MCP servers can be used with any AI assistant that supports the Model Context Protocol, making it easy to create complex color sequences through natural language commands.
