**1. Introduction & Project Goal**

This document aims to consolidate all information gathered through a series of reverse-engineering efforts on a set of smart LED juggling balls controlled over Wi-Fi. The primary goal of these efforts is to understand the communication protocols sufficiently to allow custom Python scripts to:
1.  Reliably upload new LED color sequences (``.prg`` files) to the balls. (**Status: Largely Achieved**)
2.  Reliably trigger the playback of uploaded sequences. (**Status: Partially Achieved, Unreliable**)
3.  Reliably stop the playback of sequences. (**Status: Partially Achieved, Seems More Reliable than Play**)

This document serves as the current official understanding, detailing what is known, what is hypothesized, what remains unknown, and how our understanding has evolved through various experiments and analyses of network captures.

**2. System Architecture & Network Overview**

*   **2.1. Core Components:**
    *   **Smart Juggling Ball(s):** Espressif-based (ESP32/ESP8266) devices with LEDs, Wi-Fi connectivity, and onboard firmware to store and execute sequences. They act as servers for sequence uploads and respond to UDP control commands.
    *   **Controlling Application:** Typically an official smartphone or PC application. In our case, custom Python scripts aim to replicate this functionality.
    *   **Wi-Fi Network:** A local Wi-Fi network (e.g., provided by a phone hotspot) to which both the balls and the controlling application connect.

*   **2.2. IP Addressing:**
    *   **Ball IP Address:** Dynamically assigned via DHCP on the local Wi-Fi network. This IP must be identified for each session (e.g., `192.168.40.57`, `192.168.40.205`, `192.168.40.133`, `192.168.40.234`).
    *   **Controlling PC/Script IP Address:** The IP of the machine running the Python script on the same network (e.g., `192.168.40.40`).
    *   **Broadcast Address:** UDP control commands and status broadcasts often use the general broadcast `255.255.255.255` or a subnet-specific broadcast (e.g., `192.168.40.255`).

*   **2.3. Key Ports:**
    *   **TCP Port `8888` (on Ball):** Used for sequence (``.prg`` file) uploads. The ball listens on this port for incoming TCP connections.
    *   **UDP Port `41412` (Source & Destination):** This is the primary port for:
        *   Ball status broadcasts (Ball -> Broadcast).
        *   Control commands (Play/Stop) sent from the script/app to the ball (Script/App -> Broadcast or Ball IP).
        *   (Potentially) Echoes of commands from the ball back to the script/app's ephemeral source port.

*   **2.4. Network Environment:**
    *   All communication relevant to sequence upload and control occurs over the local Wi-Fi network. No internet connectivity is required for these operations once the devices are on the same LAN.

**3. Sequence Upload Mechanism (TCP Protocol)**

*   **3.1. Overview & Status:**
    *   This mechanism is used to transfer ``.prg`` sequence files from the controlling application/script to the juggling ball's internal storage.
    *   **Status: Considered reliably reverse-engineered and successfully implemented in Python (`upload_sequence_works.py`).**

*   **3.2. Connection Details:**
    *   **Protocol:** TCP/IP
    *   **Initiator:** Controlling application/script.
    *   **Target:** `BALL_IP` on port `8888`.

*   **3.3. TCP Payload Structure (In-Depth):**
    *   The entire upload consists of a single TCP data segment (PSH, ACK from client) after the connection is established. The structure is critical.
    *   Example Total Payload Size: 389 bytes for `4px_blue_10.prg` (15-byte filename, 357-byte content).

    *   **3.3.1. Dynamic Prefix (15 Bytes):**
        *   This prefix is sent at the very beginning of the TCP payload.
        *   **Bytes 0-3:** `\x00\x00\x00\x00` (Fixed: Four null bytes).
        *   **Bytes 4-7:** `[uint32_le file_size_on_disk]` (Variable: A 4-byte little-endian unsigned integer representing the **exact size in bytes of the ``.prg`` file as it exists on the sender's disk**). Example: For a 357-byte file, this is `\x65\x01\x00\x00`.
        *   **Bytes 8-11:** `[random_4_bytes]` (Variable: A 4-byte nonce or timestamp generated by the sender. The `upload_sequence_works.py` script uses `random.getrandbits(8)` for each of the 4 bytes, and this is accepted by the ball). Example: `\x63\x3d\xba\xe1`.
        *   **Bytes 12-14:** `\x20\x00\x00` (Fixed: An ASCII space character `0x20` followed by two null bytes).

    *   **3.3.2. Null Separator (1 Byte):**
        *   `\x00` (Fixed: A single null byte immediately follows the 15-byte dynamic prefix).

    *   **3.3.3. Filename String (Variable Length, ASCII encoded):**
        *   The filename of the sequence being uploaded (e.g., "4px\_blue\_10.prg").
        *   This string is ASCII encoded. Length varies based on the filename.

    *   **3.3.4. Null Separator (1 Byte):**
        *   `\x00` (Fixed: A single null byte immediately follows the filename string, acting as its terminator).

    *   **3.3.5. Core Program (``.prg``) Content (Variable Length):**
        *   The raw binary data of the ``.prg`` sequence file.
        *   The `upload_sequence_works.py` script (and the official app for the `4px_blue_10.prg` example) sends the exact number of bytes corresponding to the original file's content (e.g., 357 bytes for `4px_blue_10.prg` if its disk size is 357 bytes). The `PRG_CONTENT_LENGTH_TO_SEND` variable in the script controls this.

*   **3.4. TCP Connection Flow & Ball's Acknowledgment:**
    1.  Client initiates TCP 3-way handshake with Ball (`SYN`, `SYN-ACK`, `ACK`).
    2.  Client sends the complete payload (Prefix + Separator + Filename + Separator + PRG Content) in one or more TCP segments (typically one `PSH, ACK` packet).
    3.  Ball's TCP stack sends `ACK` for the received data segment(s).
    4.  Client initiates graceful close by sending `FIN, ACK`.
    5.  Ball sends `ACK` for client's FIN, then sends its own `FIN, ACK`.
    6.  Client sends `ACK` for ball's FIN.
    *   **Application-Level Confirmation:** While no explicit "OK" is sent back *over this TCP connection* before the close, the ball confirms a successful upload via its subsequent UDP status broadcasts (see Section 4), which will include messages like "Mupload ok" and the uploaded filename.

*   **3.5. Python Implementation (`upload_sequence_works.py`):**
    *   The provided `upload_sequence_works.py` script accurately implements this TCP upload protocol.
    *   It correctly constructs the 15-byte dynamic prefix, including the file size and a random 4-byte nonce.
    *   It sends the filename and the specified amount of ``.prg`` file content.
    *   It handles the TCP connection, send, and shutdown sequence.

*   **3.6. Certainties and Knowns for TCP Upload:**
    *   The TCP port (`8888`) is confirmed.
    *   The 15-byte dynamic prefix structure is confirmed, especially the use of original file size and the acceptability of random bytes for the nonce portion.
    *   The inclusion of the null-terminated filename is confirmed.
    *   The fact that the ball uses the *original file size* in the prefix but the *actual amount of ``.prg`` data sent* can be controlled (and for some files, the app might send a truncated version, though for `4px_blue_10.prg` it sends the full 357 bytes) is an important detail.
    *   This part of the protocol is considered **solved and reliably working**.

**4. Ball Status Broadcasts (UDP Protocol)**

*   **4.1. Purpose & Overview:**
    *   The ball periodically broadcasts UDP packets to announce its presence, current status (idle, playing, etc.), the name of the loaded sequence, and a timestamp/counter.
    *   These broadcasts are essential for app discovery and for obtaining values (like the timestamp) needed for control commands.

*   **4.2. Connection Details:**
    *   **Protocol:** UDP
    *   **Source:** `BALL_IP:41412`
    *   **Destination:** `BROADCAST_IP:41412` (e.g., `255.255.255.255:41412` or a subnet-specific broadcast like `192.168.40.255:41412`).

*   **4.3. Observed Packet Lengths & Variations:**
    *   Several summaries mentioned different lengths (e.g., 17, 47, 62, 71 bytes). The core fields seem to be present in a consistent manner, with longer packets typically containing more ASCII data (like filenames and status messages).
    *   **"Idle/Beacon" state (before any upload or after a simple stop):** Often shorter packets (e.g., ~47 bytes). May contain "NPLAYTXBALL" or "NPLAYLTXBALL".
    *   **"Uploaded/Active" state (after a sequence upload):** Typically longer packets (e.g., ~71 bytes for `4px_blue_10.prg`), including the filename and "Mupload ok".
    *   The `trigger_sequence_13super3.py` script primarily relies on `data[10]`, `data[12]`, `data[15]`, and `data[16]` from these broadcasts.

*   **4.4. Detailed Payload Structure (Synthesized from Observations, focusing on fields relevant to control):**
    *   The exact byte-for-byte structure can vary slightly based on state and firmware, but key elements are consistent. The summary "Okay, this is a perfect time to consolidate" provided a good breakdown for a 71-byte packet post-upload, which is a reliable reference for those fields. Other summaries focused on specific bytes used by the trigger script.

    *   **4.4.1. Common Header / Identifier Fields:**
        *   **Bytes 0-3 (UDP Payload Offset 0-3):** Ball Identifier. Example: `01 XX YY ZZ`. `01` seems fixed, followed by the last 3 bytes of the ball's MAC address (e.g., `01 60 BD 17` if MAC ends in `...BD:17:60`). Some summaries show `01 25 22 b9` for MAC `...b9:22:25`.
        *   **Bytes 4-8 (UDP Payload Offset 4-8):** Often `\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00` (Fixed nulls).
        *   (Note: The "Okay, this is a perfect time to consolidate" summary had a 12-byte common prefix `01 60 [XX YY ZZ] 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00`. This aligns well.)

    *   **4.4.2. Critical Status & State Bytes (Offsets can vary slightly based on overall packet structure interpretation across summaries, but these are the key data points):**
        *   **`data[9]` (State Byte Alpha / Header Byte 1 - from "Okay, this is a great point to take stock" summary):** Highly dynamic (`\xFC` idle, `\x01` playing, `\x02` first idle after stop). Its role in command formation is unclear but indicates detailed internal state.
        *   **`data[10]` (State Byte Beta / `latest_sniffed_cmd_byte2_val` / Command Byte 2 Source):**
            *   Observed as `\x00` in some idle/beacon states.
            *   Observed as `\x01` when ball is actively playing or after initial interactions in some captures.
            *   **Strong Hypothesis (from "Okay, this is a great point to take stock"):** The value of this byte in the ball's broadcast is what the official app copies into `Byte[2]` of its *next sent command*. The `trigger_sequence_13super3.py` script *does not* use this sniffed value for sending; it hardcodes its command's Byte 2 to `0x01`.
        *   **`data[11]` (Status Counter/Byte Gamma / Play State Reflector - from "Okay, this is a great point to take stock"):** `\x00` for idle, `\x01` for playing. Mirrors `data[12]`.
        *   **`data[12]` (Play/Idle Status Byte / `latest_ball_status`):**
            *   **Consistently `\x00`:** Idle / Sequence Uploaded / Sequence Stopped.
            *   **Consistently `\x01`:** Sequence Playing.
            *   This is a primary indicator of the ball's play state.

    *   **4.4.3. Timestamp/Counter:**
        *   **Bytes 13-16 (UDP Payload Offset 13-16 from "Okay, this is a great point to take stock" and "Okay, this is a perfect time to consolidate" summaries):** A 4-byte value, likely little-endian, that increments rapidly. This is the `TS_B1 TS_B2 TS_B3 TS_B4`.
        *   **Bytes 15 & 16 (UDP Payload Offset 15 & 16 - `TS_B3` & `TS_B4`):** These two specific bytes are sniffed by `trigger_sequence_13super3.py` and echoed back in PLAY commands.

    *   **4.4.4. ASCII Data (Variable Section, typically after timestamp/fixed blocks):**
        *   **Device Identifier String:** "NPLAYLTXBALL" or "NPLAYTXBALL" often followed by `\x00F`.
        *   **Filename String:** If a sequence is uploaded, its null-terminated filename (e.g., "4px\_blue\_10.prg\x00").
        *   **Status Messages:** Null-terminated messages like "Mupload ok", "Mplay ok", "Mstop ok".
        *   **Trailer:** Often ends with a `\x7a` ('z').

*   **4.5. Certainties, Hypotheses, and Unknowns for UDP Broadcasts:**
    *   **Certain:** UDP Port (`41412`), broadcast nature, presence of MAC-related ID, a clear Play/Idle status byte (`data[12]`), and an incrementing timestamp/counter from which `TS_B3, TS_B4` are extracted for PLAY commands.
    *   **Strong Hypotheses:** The role of `data[10]` as the source for the app's command byte 2. The general structure of ASCII data for filenames and status messages.
    *   **Unknowns:** The precise meaning and interplay of `data[9]`, `data[10]`, and `data[11]` and how they fully map to the ball's internal state machine. The full structure of all possible broadcast variants and all bytes within them.

**5. Control Commands: Play & Stop (UDP Protocol)**

*   **5.1. Overview & Current Reliability:**
    *   These commands are sent by the controlling application/script to the ball to initiate or terminate sequence playback.
    *   **Status:** Partially understood. Sequence uploads are reliable. Play/Stop commands sent by the Python script (`trigger_sequence_13super3.py`) have intermittent success for PLAY (often leading to a red LED), while STOP seems more robust but is dependent on a successful PLAY. The official app performs these reliably.

*   **5.2. Connection Details:**
    *   **Protocol:** UDP
    *   **Sender:** Controlling application/script (from an OS-assigned ephemeral source port).
    *   **Destination:** `BROADCAST_IP:41412` (e.g., `255.255.255.255:41412`).

*   **5.3. General Command Packet Structure (9 Bytes):**
    *   All observed Play and Stop commands share this 9-byte length.
    *   **Byte 0:** Command Group. Consistently `\x61`.
    *   **Byte 1:** Operation ID (`OpID`). Specific to Play or Stop, and cycles.
    *   **Byte 2:** "Command Control Byte" / `command_byte2_to_use`. Critical for reliability.
    *   **Bytes 3-4:** `\x00\x00` (Fixed nulls, purpose unknown).
    *   **Bytes 5-8:** Suffix (4 bytes). Content depends on Play or Stop.
        *   For PLAY: `[P1] [P2] [TS_B3_echo] [TS_B4_echo]`
        *   For STOP (v13.1 firmware style): `\x00\x00\x00\x00`

*   **5.4. PLAY Command:**
    *   **5.4.1. Operation ID (`OpID`) (Byte 1):**
        *   A single byte that cycles.
        *   Initial value after upload/power-on: `\x14`.
        *   Increment: `(Previous_Successful_Play_OpID + 0x14) & 0xFF`.
        *   If `0x00` is calculated, it reverts to `\x14` (or another base OpID). `0x00` seems to be avoided/special.
        *   The script `trigger_sequence_13super3.py` implements this logic.

    *   **5.4.2. `command_byte2_to_use` (Payload Byte 2) - Critical Discussion:**
        *   The `trigger_sequence_13super3.py` script **hardcodes this to `\x01`**.
        *   Earlier hypotheses (and some script versions) involved deriving this from the ball's sniffed `data[10]`. This proved unreliable.
        *   The "Okay, this is a great point to take stock" summary strongly hypothesized that the *official app* copies the ball's `data[10]` value into this byte of its command.
        *   The current Python script's hardcoding to `\x01` is a simplification based on observations that `data[10]` from the ball often becomes `\x01` when active. The red LED issue suggests this hardcoding might be too simplistic if the ball's `data[10]` (and thus its expectation for command byte 2) can be other values.

    *   **5.4.3. PC-Generated Nonces (P1, P2) (Bytes 5-6):**
        *   Two bytes generated by the client.
        *   `trigger_sequence_13super3.py` uses `KNOWN_PLAY_NONCES` if the current `Play_Op_ID` is a key in that dictionary; otherwise, it generates random `P1, P2` bytes.
        *   Official app used specific nonces for initial Play cycles (`0x14 -> 0x996f`, `0x28 -> 0x3e94`) and then pseudo-random looking ones. The unreliability of Python's random nonces after a few cycles is a key issue.

    *   **5.4.4. Echoed Ball Timestamp (TS\_B3, TS\_B4) (Bytes 7-8):**
        *   These **must** be the 3rd and 4th bytes (0-indexed: bytes 15 and 16 of the UDP payload data, if using the 4-byte timestamp at offset 13) from a *recent* UDP status broadcast *from the ball*.
        *   `trigger_sequence_13super3.py` sniffs these and includes them. This is a confirmed requirement.

    *   **5.4.5. Full PLAY Payload Example (using `PlayOpID=0x14`, `CmdByte2=0x01`, `P1P2=0x996f`, `TS_B3B4=0xABCF`):**
        `\x61 \x14 \x01 \x00\x00 \x99\x6f \xab\xcf`

    *   **5.4.6. Ball's Response to PLAY:**
        *   **Success:** Ball starts playing the sequence. Its UDP broadcast status byte (`data[12]`) changes to `\x01`. It *may* echo the 9-byte PLAY command it received back to the sender's ephemeral port (this was observed with the official app).
        *   **Failure (e.g., with Python script):** Ball does not play. A red LED illuminates. UDP status (`data[12]`) usually remains `\x00`. Whether it echoes the failing command needs confirmation.

*   **5.5. STOP Command:**
    *   **5.5.1. Operation ID (`OpID`) (Byte 1):**
        *   Derived from the `Play_Op_ID` of the sequence currently playing: `(Currently_Playing_Play_OpID + 0x0A) & 0xFF`.
        *   Implemented by `trigger_sequence_13super3.py`.

    *   **5.5.2. `command_byte2_to_use` (Payload Byte 2):**
        *   The `trigger_sequence_13super3.py` script **hardcodes this to `\x01`**, similar to PLAY.
        *   The same discussion as for PLAY applies regarding the official app potentially using the ball's `data[10]`.

    *   **5.5.3. Suffix Bytes (Nonces & Timestamp) (Bytes 5-8):**
        *   The `trigger_sequence_13super3.py` (and observations of "v13.1 firmware" style stop commands) uses `\x00\x00\x00\x00` for this entire 4-byte suffix.
        *   Some earlier summaries/experiments explored echoing timestamps or nonces here, but the simpler all-zeros suffix seems to be the current approach for the script.

    *   **5.5.4. Full STOP Payload Example (using `StopOpID=0x1E` (derived from `PlayOpID=0x14`), `CmdByte2=0x01`):**
        `\x61 \x1e \x01 \x00\x00 \x00\x00\x00\x00`

    *   **5.5.5. Ball's Response to STOP:**
        *   **Success:** Ball stops playing. Its UDP broadcast status byte (`data[12]`) changes to `\x00`.
        *   The "Okay, this is a great point to take stock" summary noted that STOP commands *are also echoed* by the ball in some captures, especially if `Byte[2]` of the command was `\x01`. This contradicted earlier notes.

*   **5.6. Python Implementation (`trigger_sequence_13super3.py`):**
    *   Implements OpID cycling for PLAY and derivation for STOP.
    *   Uses a background thread for sniffing ball status (`TS_B3, TS_B4`, `data[10]`, `data[12]`).
    *   Hardcodes `command_byte2_to_use` to `\x01` for both PLAY and STOP.
    *   Uses random or known nonces for PLAY, and zeroed suffix for STOP.
    *   Includes MP3 playback synchronization attempts with a `BALL_STARTUP_DELAY`.
    *   Collects user feedback on command success.

*   **5.7. Certainties, Hypotheses, and Primary Unknowns for UDP Control:**
    *   **Certain:** UDP Port (`41412`), broadcast destination, 9-byte command length, `\x61` command group, OpID cycling logic (+0x14 for play, +0x0A for stop), necessity of echoing fresh `TS_B3, TS_B4` for PLAY.
    *   **Strong Hypotheses:** The role of `command_byte2_to_use` is critical and likely tied to the ball's internal state (possibly reflected in its `data[10]` byte). Nonces `P1,P2` are needed for PLAY.
    *   **Primary Unknowns for PLAY reliability:**
        1.  **The `command_byte2_to_use` (Byte 2):** Is hardcoding to `\x01` sufficient, or must it dynamically match something from the ball's broadcast (like `data[10]`) as the official app might do? This is the leading suspect for the red LED.
        2.  **Nonces `P1, P2` for PLAY (Bytes 5-6):** Why do random nonces eventually fail? Are there specific valid ranges? Is there a longer sequence or algorithm used by the official app? Or is their failure a symptom of an incorrect `command_byte2_to_use`?
        3.  **The "double send" of PLAY commands by the official app:** Is this necessary for reliability or for a specific state transition?
    *   **Unknowns for STOP:** Is the `\x00\x00\x00\x00` suffix always correct, or does it sometimes need dynamic values like PLAY?

**6. Key Operational Logic & State Management (UDP Control)**

*   **6.1. Operation ID (`OpID`) Sequencing and Cycling:**
    *   **Play OpIDs:** Start (e.g., `0x14`), increment by `0x14` per successful play/stop cycle, wrap at `0xFF`, avoid `0x00`.
    *   **Stop OpIDs:** Derived from the `PlayOpID` that started the sequence (`PlayOpID + 0x0A`).
    *   This logic implies the ball tracks the expected next `PlayOpID` or current playing `OpID`.

*   **6.2. Timestamp Echoing (Anti-Replay):**
    *   Echoing the ball's `TS_B3, TS_B4` in PLAY commands is vital. This ensures command "freshness" and acknowledges a recent ball state. Outdated timestamps likely lead to command rejection (red LED).

*   **6.3. Nonce Usage & `KNOWN_PLAY_NONCES`:**
    *   `P1, P2` nonces in PLAY commands likely make each attempt unique or could be part of a challenge-response not fully understood.
    *   `KNOWN_PLAY_NONCES` suggests specific nonces might trigger specific behaviors or were simply observed during successful plays with certain OpIDs. Their exact necessity vs. randomness is still debated, especially if `command_byte2_to_use` is the primary issue.

*   **6.4. The `command_byte2_to_use` (Payload Byte 2) Saga - Evolution of Understanding:**
    *   **Initial thought (from some summaries):** This byte might be fixed or based on simple conditions.
    *   **Intermediate thought (from `trigger_sequence_13super2.py` era):** Derived from `data[10]` of the ball's sniffed packet, but this was complex and unreliable.
    *   **"Okay, this is a great point to take stock" summary:** Hypothesized the official app *copies* the ball's `data[10]` into its command's byte 2. This implies the ball's `data[10]` reflects an internal state that the command must acknowledge.
    *   **`trigger_sequence_13super3.py` approach:** Hardcodes command byte 2 to `\x01`. This works sometimes, likely when the ball's internal state (and its `data[10]`) aligns with expecting `\x01`. When they don't align, it fails (red LED).
    *   **Current Prime Hypothesis:** The official app dynamically sets its command's byte 2 based on the ball's broadcast `data[10]`. The Python script needs to adopt this for full reliability.

*   **6.5. Client-Side State Tracking (`is_playing_assumed`, etc.):**
    *   Due to UDP's connectionless nature, the controlling script must maintain an assumed state of the ball (playing/stopped, last Play OpID) to generate correct subsequent commands. User feedback in `trigger_sequence_13super3.py` helps manage this.

**7. Observed Ball Behaviors**

*   **7.1. Successful Operations (Upload, Play, Stop):**
    *   **Upload:** Ball stores the sequence, UDP broadcasts confirm with "Mupload ok" and filename.
    *   **Play:** Ball illuminates with the sequence, UDP status byte (`data[12]`) becomes `\x01`.
    *   **Stop:** Ball ceases sequence, UDP status byte (`data[12]`) becomes `\x00`.

*   **7.2. The "Red LED" Error State:**
    *   Illuminates on the ball when a PLAY command from the Python script is rejected.
    *   Indicates an invalid command parameter or a mismatch with the ball's expected internal state.
    *   Most likely cause: Incorrect `command_byte2_to_use` and/or incorrect/stale `P1,P2` nonces or `TS_B3,TS_B4` echo.

*   **7.3. Command Echoing by the Ball:**
    *   The ball has been observed to echo back the 9-byte PLAY command it received when the command is successful (from official app captures).
    *   It has also been observed to echo STOP commands in some captures ("Okay, this is a great point to take stock" summary), especially if byte 2 of the command was `0x01`.
    *   Whether it echoes failing commands (that result in a red LED) is an important point for diagnosis.

**8. Python Scripts Overview**

*   **8.1. `upload_sequence_works.py`:**
    *   Successfully implements the TCP sequence upload protocol.
    *   Correctly constructs the 15-byte dynamic prefix using file size and random nonce.
    *   Considered a working and stable script for its specific purpose.

*   **8.2. `trigger_sequence_13super3.py` (and its predecessor `trigger_sequence_13super2.py`):**
    *   Attempts to implement UDP Play/Stop control.
    *   `trigger_sequence_13super3.py` is the latest version provided.
    *   Features:
        *   Background sniffing thread for ball status (`TS_B3,TS_B4`, `data[10]`, `data[12]`).
        *   OpID cycling for PLAY, OpID derivation for STOP.
        *   **Hardcodes `command_byte2_to_use` to `\x01` for sent commands.**
        *   Uses known or random nonces for PLAY; zeroed suffix for STOP.
        *   Includes MP3 sync logic and user feedback collection.
    *   Reliability: Intermittent for PLAY (often red LED), better for STOP if PLAY was successful.
    *   `trigger_sequence_13super2.py` was an earlier version that also hardcoded `command_byte2_to_use` to `\x01` but had a more complex sniffing display logic. The core command sending logic for byte 2 was similar in its fixed nature.

**9. Contradictions and Evolving Understanding**

*   **TCP Dynamic Prefix:** Initial understanding of the 15-byte prefix for TCP uploads was vague and changed several times. The final version in `upload_sequence_works.py` (with original file size and random 4-byte nonce) is the confirmed correct one.
*   **`command_byte2_to_use` (UDP Control Byte 2):** This has seen the most evolution:
    *   Initial ideas: Fixed value or simple logic.
    *   Hypothesis: Derived from ball's `data[10]` (from "Okay, this is an excellent exercise!").
    *   Hypothesis: `0x00` initially, `0x01` after OpID wrap (from "Okay, this is a great point to take stock" before the deep dive into app behavior).
    *   Current scripts (`trigger_sequence_13super3.py`): Hardcoded to `\x01`.
    *   Latest strong hypothesis (from app analysis in "Okay, this is a great point to take stock"): Official app copies ball's `data[10]` to its command's byte 2. This is the most promising path for Python script reliability.
*   **STOP Command Suffix:** Initially thought to always be `\x00\x00\x00\x00`. Some discussions explored dynamic values, but current scripts stick to the all-zeros suffix.
*   **STOP Command Echo:** Initially thought not to be echoed by the ball. Later captures (noted in "Okay, this is a great point to take stock") showed that STOP commands *can* be echoed.
*   **Ball's UDP Broadcast `data[10]`:** Its significance was initially just "sniffed value" but has grown to be a prime candidate for direct use in command formation by the official app.

**10. Summary of What Is Certain**

*   **Network:** Wi-Fi based, local LAN communication. DHCP for ball IP.
*   **TCP Upload:** Port `8888`. The 15-byte prefix structure (4 nulls, 4-byte LE file size, 4-byte random nonce, space+2 nulls), followed by null, ASCII filename, null, and PRG content is **certain and works**.
*   **UDP Control/Status:** Port `41412` for ball broadcasts and commands. Commands are 9 bytes.
*   **UDP Command Byte 0:** `\x61` for Play/Stop.
*   **UDP Play OpID:** Starts `0x14`, increments by `0x14`, wraps, avoids `0x00`.
*   **UDP Stop OpID:** `PlayOpID + 0x0A`.
*   **UDP Play Command Timestamp Echo:** Bytes 7-8 of PLAY command must echo bytes 15-16 (0-indexed) of a recent ball UDP status broadcast.
*   **Ball UDP Broadcast `data[12]`:** `\x00` for Idle/Stopped, `\x01` for Playing.
*   **Ball UDP Broadcast `data[15]`, `data[16]`:** Source for the echoed timestamp in PLAY commands.

**11. Summary of Strong Hypotheses**

*   **`command_byte2_to_use` (UDP Command Byte 2):** The official app likely sets this byte to the value of `data[10]` from the ball's most recent UDP status broadcast. This is the **leading hypothesis for fixing Python script PLAY reliability.**
*   **Nonces `P1,P2` for PLAY:** While the first few may be fixed, subsequent ones by the app appear pseudo-random. Their exact generation or validation by the ball is not fully known, but they are necessary. Their failure in Python might be secondary to an incorrect `command_byte2_to_use`.
*   **Ball UDP Broadcast `data[9]`, `data[10]`, `data[11]`:** These bytes reflect a more detailed internal state of the ball beyond the simple Play/Idle status in `data[12]`. `data[10]` is particularly key.
*   **Red LED:** Caused by the ball rejecting a command due to a mismatch with its internal state/expectations, primarily related to `command_byte2_to_use`, nonces, or stale timestamps.

**12. Summary of Key Unknowns & Areas Requiring Further Investigation**

1.  **Definitive proof and implementation for `command_byte2_to_use`:** Modifying the Python script to set command byte 2 based on the sniffed `data[10]` from the ball is the TOP PRIORITY.
2.  **Nonce `P1,P2` generation for PLAY:** If `command_byte2_to_use` is fixed, why do random nonces eventually fail? Is there a specific algorithm, valid range, or sequence the official app uses that the Python script needs to replicate?
3.  **Purpose of Ball UDP Broadcast `data[9]` and `data[11]`:** How do they relate to the ball's state, and do they influence command generation by the app?
4.  **Official App's "Double Send" of PLAY Commands:** Is this for UDP reliability, or does it serve a specific state transition or acknowledgment purpose?
5.  **Exact content of Ball UDP Broadcasts in all states:** A full byte-for-byte mapping for different states (e.g., error, low battery) would be beneficial.
6.  **Recovery from Red LED state by Official App:** What exact command(s) does the app send to recover a ball from the red LED state?
7.  **Other Command Groups (UDP Command Byte 0):** Are there values other than `\x61` for different functions (e.g., brightness, direct color set, query battery, config)?
8.  **Structure of `.prg` files:** While not strictly needed for upload/trigger, understanding their internal format would allow for programmatic generation of new sequences. (This was mentioned as a more advanced step in one summary).
9.  **UDP STOP Command Suffix (Bytes 5-8):** Is it always `\x00\x00\x00\x00`, or does it sometimes require dynamic values like the PLAY command under certain conditions or firmware versions?

**13. Conclusion & Next Steps**

Significant progress has been made, particularly in understanding and implementing the TCP sequence upload protocol. The UDP control protocol for Play/Stop is partially understood, with key elements like OpID cycling and timestamp echoing identified.

The primary obstacle to reliable Play/Stop control via Python scripts is believed to be the correct determination of **`command_byte2_to_use` (UDP command payload byte 2)** and potentially the generation of the **`P1,P2` nonces for PLAY commands**.

**Immediate Next Steps for Investigation:**
1.  **Modify `trigger_sequence_13super3.py`:**
    *   Change the logic for `command_byte2_to_use` in both PLAY and STOP commands. Instead of hardcoding to `\x01`, set it to the value sniffed from the ball's UDP broadcast `data[10]` (`latest_sniffed_cmd_byte2_val`).
2.  **Systematic Testing:** Thoroughly test this modified script, capturing detailed logs and correlating with Wireshark captures, especially:
    *   The transition from idle to first play.
    *   Multiple play/stop cycles.
    *   Behavior when the script is started and the ball is already in an active (playing or recently stopped) state.
3.  **Analyze New Wireshark Captures:** Focus on captures showing the official app successfully controlling the ball, paying extremely close attention to:
    *   The value of `data[10]` in the ball's UDP broadcast immediately preceding an app command.
    *   The value of byte 2 in the app's subsequent command.
    *   The `P1,P2` nonces used by the app over many cycles.
    *   How the app recovers the ball if it enters a red LED state (if this can be induced and captured).

This iterative process of hypothesis, implementation, testing, and analysis remains the core strategy for fully reverse-engineering the juggling ball communication protocol.
