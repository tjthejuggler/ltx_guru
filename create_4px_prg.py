    This is a simplified "from scratch" approach that 
    constructs the known pattern for 4-pixel sequences:
       FileSize = 357 + 319*(num_segments - 1)
    
    The approach:
      - Write an extended header that lumps in durations for each segment.
      - Build a pixel data block of the appropriate total size:
          * 304 bytes for the first segment chunk
          * +319 bytes for each subsequent segment
        in which each chunk has a 3-byte 0x00 prefix,
        repeated color patterns, and if it is the final segment,
        we set its last byte to 0x42.
      - Write a suitable footer (which typically merges into 
        the last chunk as "42 54 ..." near the end).

    "4px_red_100_green_100_blue_100.prg", etc.

    # plus the special segment definitions is actually ~0x50 bytes or so

    # the second is near offset 0x30, the third near offset 0x40, etc.
    
    # *** Hack approach ***:
    # For 2 segments, we only patch the first 2 durations in the places 
    # that the original 3-seg file stored them, and set the segment count to 2. 
    # For 3 segments, patch all 3.
    
    # The real offsets for these durations in "4px_red_100_green_100_blue_100.prg" 
    # are quite scattered. One can open the file in a hex editor and see where 
    # the durations are stored. We'll do a simplified patch approach:
    
    # 1) Patch the "3b 00" at offset 0x10 => total header length or total file size? 
    #    We will set it to the correct number if needed. 
    # 2) Patch offset 0x14 => segment count = s
